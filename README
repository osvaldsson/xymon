README file for Xymon
=====================

What is it ?
------------
Xymon is a system for monitoring your network servers and 
applications. It is heavily inspired by the Big Brother
tool, but is a complete re-implementation with a lot of added
functionality and performance improvements. A slightly more
detailed rationale for Xymon is in the docs/about.html file.

NOTE: On Nov 10 2008, Hobbit was officially renamed to
"Xymon". The name "Hobbit" is trademarked, and therefore
cannot be used without permission from the trademark
holders. 


How to install
--------------
Detailed installation instructions are in the 
docs/install.html file. Essentially, it boils down
to running
	./configure
	make
	make install
but do have a look at the install.html file for more
detailed instructions.


Documentation
-------------
The docs/ directory holds information about the basic
installation and configuration of Xymon. All of the
tools and configuration files in Xymon have man-pages
that are installed automatically when installing Xymon.
The xymon(7) man page provides an introduction to 
Xymon and has pointers to the other man-pages of the
package.

form of a book, CD or DVD is appreciated.
