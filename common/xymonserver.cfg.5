.TH XYMONSERVER.CFG 5 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
xymonserver.cfg \- Xymon environment variables

.SH DESCRIPTION
Xymon programs use multiple environment variables beside the
normal set of variables.  The environment definitions
are stored in the ~Xymon/server/etc/xymonserver.cfg file. 
Each line in this file is of the form \fBNAME=VALUE\fR and defines
one environment variable NAME with the value VALUE.

You can also append data to existing variables, using the
syntax \fBNAME+=VALUE\fR. VALUE is then appended to the existing
value of the NAME variable. If NAME has not been defined, then
this acts as if it were a normal definition.

.SH ENVIRONMENT AREAS
In some cases it may be useful to have different values for an environment
variable, depending on where it is used. This is possible by defining
variables with an associated "area". Such definitions have the form
\fBAREA/NAME=VALUE\fR.

E.g. to define a special setup of the XYMSERVERS variable when it is used
by an application in the "management" area, you would do this:
.IP
.nf
  XYMSERVERS="127.0.0.1"            # Default definition
  management/XYMSERVERS="10.1.0.5"  # Definition in the "management" area
.fi
.LP
Areas are invoked by using the "--area" option for all tools, or via the 
ENVAREA setting in the
.I tasks.cfg(5)
file.

.SH GENERAL SETTINGS

.IP XYMONSERVERHOSTNAME
The fully-qualified hostname of the server that is running Xymon.

.IP XYMONSERVERWWWNAME
The hostname used to access this servers' web-pages, used to construct
URL's in the Xymon webpages. Default is the XYMONSERVERHOSTNAME.

.IP XYMONSERVERIP
The public IP-address of the server that is running Xymon.

.IP XYMONSERVEROS
A name identifying the operating system of the Xymon server. The 
known names are currently "linux", "freebsd", "solaris", "hpux",
"aix" and "osf".

.IP FQDN
If set to TRUE, Xymon will use fully-qualified hostnames throughout.
If set to FALSE, hostnames are stripped of their domain-part before
being processed. It is \fBhighly recommended\fR that you keep this
set to TRUE. Default: TRUE.

.IP XYMONLOGSTATUS
Controls how the HTML page for a status log is generated. If set to
DYNAMIC, the HTML logs are generated on-demand by the 
.I svcstatus.cgi(1)
script. If set to STATIC, you must activate the
.I xymond_filestore(8)
module (through an entry in the
.I tasks.cfg(5)
file) to create and store the HTML logs whenever a status update is
received. Setting "XYMONLOGSTATUS=STATIC" is \fBdiscouraged\fR since the
I/O load on the Xymon server will increase significantly.

.IP PINGCOLUMN
Defines the name of the column for "ping" test status. The data from
the "ping" test is used internally by Xymon, so it must be defined
here so all of the Xymon tools know which column to watch for this 
data. The default setting is PINGCOLUMN=conn.

.IP INFOCOLUMN
Defines the name of the column for the "info" pages.

.IP TRENDSCOLUMN
Defines the name of the column for the RRD graph pages.

.IP RRDHEIGHT
The default height (in pixels) of the RRD graph images.
Default: 120 pixels.

.IP RRDWIDTH
The default width (in pixels) of the RRD graph images.
Default: 576 pixels.

.IP TRENDSECONDS
The graphs on the "trends" page show data for the past TRENDSECONDS
seconds. Default: 172800 seconds, i.e. 48 hours.

.IP HTMLCONTENTTYPE
The Content-type reported by the CGI scripts that generate web pages.
By default, this it "text/html". If you have on-line help texts in
character sets other than the ISO-8859-1 (western european) character
set, it may be necessary to modify this to include a character set.
E.g.
.br
   HTMLCONTENTTYPE="text/html; charset=euc-jp"
.br
for a Japanese character sets. Note: Some webservers will automatically
add this, if configured to do so.

.IP HOLIDAYS
Defines the default set of holidays used if there is no "holidays" 
tag for a host in the hosts.cfg file. Holiday sets are defined in the
.I holidays.cfg(5)
file. If not defined, only the default holidays (those defined outside
a named holiday set) will be considered as holidays.

.IP WEEKSTART
Defines which day is the first day of the week. Set to "0" for Sunday,
"1" for Monday. Default: 1 (Monday).

.IP XYMONBODYHEADER
Text that is included in the Xymon web pages at the location specified
by ~xymon/server/web/*_header templates. If this is set to a value
beginning with "file:", then the contents of the specified file is
included. Default: "file:$XYMONHOME/etc/xymonmenu.cfg"

.IP XYMONBODYFOOTER
Text that is included in the Xymon web pages at the location specified
by ~xymon/server/web/*_footer templates. If this is set to a value
beginning with "file:", then the contents of the specified file is
included. Default: Empty.

.IP XYMONBODYMENUCSS
URL for the Xymon menu CSS file. Default: "$XYMONMENUSKIN/xymonmenu.css"

.IP HOSTPOPUP
Determines what is used as the host comment on the webpages. The comment 
by default appears as a pop-up when the mouse hovers over the hostname, 
and is also shown on the "info" status page. This setting must be one or
more of the letters "C" (COMMENT), "D" (DESCRIPTION) or "I" (IP-address).
Including "C" uses the COMMENT setting for the host, including "D" uses 
the DESCR setting for the host, and "I" uses the IP-address of the host.
If more than one of these is set, then COMMENT takes precedence over
DESCR which again has precence over IP.
Note that DESCR and IP only appear in pop-up windows (if enabled),
whereas the COMMENT is always used - if pop-up's have been disabled, then
the COMMENT value is displayed next to the hostname on the webpages.
Default: CDI

.IP STATUSLIFETIME
The number of minutes that a status is considered valid after an update.
After this time elapses, the status will go purple.
Default: 30 minutes

.IP XYMONSERVERROOT
The top-level directory for the Xymon installation. The default 
is the home-directory for the user running Xymon.

.IP XYMONSERVERLOGS
The directory for the Xymon's own logfiles (NOT the status-logs
from the monitored hosts).

.IP XYMONHOME
The Xymon server directory, where programs and configurations are kept.
Default: $XYMONSERVERROOT/server/ .

.IP XYMONTMP
Directory used for temporary files. Default: $XYMONHOME/tmp/

Default: $XYMONHOME/www/notes/

.IP XYMONREPDIR
Directory for Xymon availability reports. The $XYMONREPURL URL must map to this directory.
Note also that your webserver must have write-access to this directory, if you want to
use the 
.I report.cgi(1)
CGI script to generate reports on-demand. Default: $XYMONHOME/www/rep/

.IP XYMONSNAPDIR
Directory for Xymon snapshots. The $XYMONSNAPURL URL must map to this directory.
Note also that your webserver must have write-access to this directory, if you want to
use the 
.I snapshot.cgi(1)
CGI script to generate snapshots on-demand. Default: $XYMONHOME/www/snap/

.IP XYMONVAR
Directory for all data stored about the monitored items. 
Default: $XYMONSERVERROOT/data/

.IP XYMONRAWSTATUSDIR
Directory for storing the raw status-logs. Not used unless
"xymond_filestore --status" is running, which is \fBdiscouraged\fR
since it increases the load on the Xymon server significantly.
Default: $XYMONVAR/logs/

.IP XYMONHTMLSTATUSDIR
Directory for storing HTML status-logs. Not used unless
"xymond_filestore --status --html" is running, which is \fBdiscouraged\fR
since it increases the load on the Xymon server significantly.

time a status changes to a warning (yellow) or critical (red) state.
Used by the
.I xymond_hostdata(8)
module.
Default: $XYMONVAR/hostdata/

.IP XYMONCGILOGDIR
Directory where debug output from CGI applications are stored. If not
specified, it defaults to $XYMONSERVERLOGS, but this is often a directory
that is not writable by the userid running the CGI applications. It
is therefore recommended when using "--debug" on CGI applications that
you create a separate directory owned by the user running your webserver,
and point XYMONCGILOGDIR to this directory.


.SH SYSTEM FILES

.IP HOSTSCFG
Full path to the Xymon
.I hosts.cfg(5)
configuration file. Default: $XYMONHOME/etc/hosts.cfg.

Full path to the
.I xymongen(1)
webpage generator program. Default: $XYMONHOME/bin/xymongen.


.SH URLS
.IP XYMONSERVERWWWURL
The root URL for the Xymon webpages, without the hostname. This
URL must be mapped to the ~/server/www/ directory in your webserver
configuration. See the sample Apache configuration in ~/server/etc/xymon-apache.conf.

.IP XYMONSERVERCGIURL
The root URL for the Xymon CGI-scripts, without the hostname. This
directory must be mapped to the ~/cgi-bin/ directory in your webserver
configuration, and must be flagged as holding executable scripts. See

hostname, e.g. "http://www.foo.com"

.IP XYMONWEBHOSTURL
Prefix for all of the static Xymon webpages, e.g. "http://www.foo.com/xymon"

.IP XYMONWEBHTMLLOGS
URL prefix for the static HTML status-logs generated when XYMONLOGSTATUS=STATIC.
Note that this setting is \fBdiscouraged\fR so this setting should not be used.

.IP XYMONWEB
URL prefix (without hostname) of the Xymon webpages. E.g. "/xymon".

.IP XYMONSKIN
URL prefix (without hostname) of the Xymon graphics. E.g. "/xymon/gifs".

.IP XYMONHELPSKIN

.IP COLUMNDOCURL
Format string used to build a link to the documentation for a column heading.
Default: "$CGIBINURL/columndoc.sh?%s", which causes links to use the
.I columndoc.sh(1)
script to document a column.

.IP HOSTDOCURL
Format string used to build a link to the documentation for a host.
If not set, then Xymon falls back to scanning the XYMONNOTES directory
for files matching the hostname, or the hostname together with a common
filename extension (.php, .html, .doc and so on). If set, this string
becomes a formatting string for the documentation URL. E.g. for the host
"myhost", a setting of HOSTDOCURL="/docs/%s.php" will generate a link to
"/docs/myhost.php".
Default: Not set, so host documentation will be retrieved from the
XYMONNOTES directory.


.SH SETTINGS FOR SENDING MESSAGES TO XYMON
.IP XYMSRV
The IP-address used to contact the
.I xymond(8)
service. Used by clients and the tools that perform network tests.
Default: $XYMONSERVERIP

.IP XYMSERVERS
List of IP-adresses. Clients and network test tools will try to
send status reports to a Xymon server running on each of these
adresses. This setting is only used if XYMSRV=0.0.0.0.

.IP XYMONDPORT
The portnumber for used to contact the
.I xymond(8)
service. Used by clients and the tools that perform network tests.
Default: 1984.

.IP MAXMSGSPERCOMBO
The maximum number of status messages to combine into one
combo message.  Default: 100.

.IP SLEEPBETWEENMSGS
Length of a pause introduced between each successive transmission
of a combo-message by xymonnet, in microseconds. Default: 0 
(send messages as quickly as possible).


.SH XYMOND SETTINGS

.IP ALERTCOLORS
Comma-separated list of the colors that may trigger an alert-message.
The default is "red,yellow,purple". Note that alerts may further be
generated or suppresed based on the configuration in the
.I alerts.cfg(5)
file.

.IP OKCOLORS
Comma-separated list of the colors that may trigger a recovery-message.
The default is "green,clear,blue".

.IP ALERTREPEAT
How often alerts get repeated while a status is in an alert state.
This is the default setting, which may be changed in the 
.I alerts.cfg(5)
file.

.IP MAXMSG_STATUS
The maximum size of a "status" message in kB, default: 256.
Status messages are the ones that end up as columns on the 
web display. The default size should be adequate in most
cases, but some extension scripts can generate very large
status messages - close to 1024 kB. You should only change
this if you see messages in the xymond log file about status
messages being truncated.

.IP MAXMSG_CLIENT
The maximum size of a "client" message in kB, default: 512.
"client" messages are generated by the Xymon client, and often
include large process-listings. You should only change
this if you see messages in the xymond log file about client
messages being truncated.

.IP MAXMSG_DATA
The maximum size of a "data" message in kB, default: 256.
"data" messages are typically used for client reports of
e.g. netstat or vmstat data. You should only change this
setting if you see messages in the xymond log file about
data messages being truncated.

.IP MAXMSG_NOTES
The maximum size of a "notes" message in kB, default: 256.
"notes" messages provide a way for uploading documentation
about a host to Xymon; it is not enabled by default. If you 
want to upload large documents, you may need to change this
setting.

.IP MAXMSG_STACHG
The maximum size of a "status change" message in kB, default: 
Current value of the MAXMSG_STATUS setting.  Status-change 
messages occur when a status changes color. There is no 
reason to change this setting.

.IP MAXMSG_PAGE
The maximum size of a "page" message in kB, default: 
Current value of the MAXMSG_STATUS setting. "page" messages
are alerts, and include the status message that triggers the
alert. There is no reason to change this setting.

.IP MAXMSG_ENADIS
The maximum size of an "enadis" message in kB, default: 32.
"enadis" are small messages used when enabling or disabling
hosts and tests, so the default size should be adequate.

.IP MAXMSG_CLICHG
The maximum size of a "client change" message in kB, default: 
Current value of the MAXMSG_CLIENT setting.  Client-change 
messages occur when a status changes color to one of the
alert-colors, usually red, yellow and purple. There is no 
reason to change this setting.

.IP MAXMSG_USER
The maximum size of a "user" message in kB, default: 128.
"user" messages are for communication between custom Xymon
modules you have installed, it is not used directly by
Xymon.


.SH XYMOND_HISTORY SETTINGS

.IP XYMONALLHISTLOG
If set to TRUE,
.I xymond_history(8)
will update the $XYMONHISTDIR/allevents file logging all changes to
a status. The allevents file is used by the
.I eventlog.cgi(1)
tool to show the list of recent events on the "All non-green" 
webpage.

.IP XYMONHOSTHISTLOG
If set to TRUE,
.I xymond_history(8)
will update the host-specific eventlog that keeps record
of all status changes for a host. This logfile is not used
by any Xymon tool.

.IP SAVESTATUSLOG
If set to TRUE,
.I xymond_history(8)
will save historical detailed status-logs to the $XYMONHISTLOGS
directory.


.SH XYMOND_ALERT SETTINGS

.IP MAIL
Command used to send alerts via e-mail, including a "Subject:"
header in the mail. Default: "mail -s"

.IP MAILC
Command used to send alerts via e-mail in a form that does not
have a "Subject" in the mail. Default: "mail"

.IP SVCCODES
Maps status-columns to numeric service-codes. The numeric codes are
used when sending an alert using a script, where the numeric code of
the service is provided in the BBSVCNUM variable.


.SH XYMOND_RRD SETTINGS

.IP TEST2RRD
List of "COLUMNNAME[=RRDSERVICE]" settings, that define which
status- and data-messages have a corresponding RRD graph. You will 
normally not need to modify this, unless you have added a
custom TCP-based test to the protocols.cfg file, and want to collect data about
the response-time, OR if you are using the
.I xymond_rrd(8)
external script mechanism to collect data from custom tests. 
Note: All TCP tests are automatically added.

This is also used by the 
.I svcstatus.cgi(1) 
script to determine if the detailed status view of a test should 
include a graph.

.IP GRAPHS
List of the RRD databases, that should be shown as a graph on
the "trends" column.

.IP NORRDDISKS
This is used to disable the tracking of certain filesystems. By default
all filesystems reported by a client are tracked. In some cases you may want 
to disable this for certain filesystems, e.g. database filesystems since they
are always completely full. This setting is a regular expression that is matched
against the filesystem name (the Unix mount-point, or the Windows disk-letter) -
if the filesystem name matches this expression, then it will not be tracked
by Xymon.
.br
Note: Setting this does not affect filesystems that are already being tracked
by Xymon - to remove them, you must remove the RRD files for the unwanted filesystems
from the ~xymon/data/rrd/HOSTNAME/ directory.

.IP RRDDISKS
This is used to enable tracking of only selected filesystems (see the NORRDDISKS
setting above). By default all filesystems are being tracked, setting this changes 
that default so that only those filesystems that match this pattern will be 
tracked.


.SH XYMONNET NETWORK TEST SETTINGS

.IP XYMONNETWORK
If this variable is defined, then only the hosts that have been tagged
with "NET:$XYMONNETWORK" will be tested by the xymonnet tool.

.IP CONNTEST
If set to TRUE, the connectivity (ping) test will be performed.

.IP IPTEST_2_CLEAR_ON_FAILED_CONN
If set to TRUE, then failing network tests go CLEAR if the conn-test fails.

.IP NONETPAGE
List of network services (separated with <space>) that should go yellow
upon failure instead of red.

.IP XYMONROUTERTEXT
When using the "router" or "depends" tags for a host, a failure
status will include text that an "Intermediate router is down".
With todays network topologies, the router could be a switch or
another network device; if you define this environment variable
the word "router" will be replaced with whatever you put into
the variable. So to inform the users that an intermediate switch
or router is down, use XYMONROUTERTEXT="switch or router".  This can 
also be set on a per-host basis using the "DESCR:hosttype:description"
tag in the 
.I hosts.cfg(5)
file.

.IP NETFAILTEXT
When a network test fails, the status message reports "SERVICENAME
not OK". The "not OK" message can be changed via this variable, e.g.
you can change it to "FAILED" or customize it as you like.

.IP FPING
The command used to run the
.I xymonping(1)
tool for the connectivity test. (The name FPING is due to the fact that
the "fping" utility was used until Xymon version 4.2). This may include 
suid-root wrappers and xymonping options.
Default: "xymonping"

.IP TRACEROUTE
Defines the location of the "traceroute" tool and
any options needed to run it. traceroute it used by
the connectivity test when the ping test fails; if
requested via the "trace" tag, the TRACEROUTE command
is executed to try to determine the point in the
network that is causing the problem. By default the
command executed is "traceroute -n -q 2 -w 2 -m 15"
(no DNS lookup, max. 2 probes, wait 2 seconds per hop,
max 15 hops).
.sp
If you have the
.I mtr(8)
tool installed - available from http://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/ - I
strongly recommend using this instead. The recommended
setting for mtr is "/usr/sbin/mtr -c 2 -n --report" (the
exact path to the mtr utility may be different on your 
system).  Note that mtr needs to be installed suid-root 
on most systems.

.IP NTPDATE
Defines the 
.I ntpdate(1)
program used for the "ntp" test.  
Default: "ntpdate"

.IP RPCINFO
Defines the
.I rpcinfo(8)
program used for "rpc" tests.
Default: "rpcinfo"


.SH XYMONGEN WEBPAGE GENERATOR SETTINGS

.IP XYMONLOGO
HTML code that is inserted on all standard headers. The default is to add
the text "Xymon" in the upper-left corner of the page, but you can easily 
replace this with e.g. a company logo. If you do, I suggest that you keep 
it at about 30-35 pixels high, and 100-150 pixels wide.

.IP XYMONPAGELOCAL
The string "Pages hosted locally" that appears above all of the pages
linked from the main Xymon webpage.

.IP XYMONPAGESUBLOCAL
The string "Subpages hosted locally" that appears above all of the sub-pages
linked from pages below the main Xymon webpage.

.IP XYMONPAGEREMOTE
The string "Remote status display" that appears about the summary
statuses displayed on the min Xymon webpage.

.IP XYMONPAGETITLE
HTML tags designed to go in a <FONT> tag, to choose the font for 
titles of the webpages.

.IP XYMONPAGEROWFONT
HTML tags designed to go in a <FONT> tag, to choose the font for 
row headings (hostnames) on the webpages.

.IP XYMONPAGECOLFONT
HTML tags designed to go in a <FONT> tag, to chose the font for
column headings (test names) on the webpages.

.IP XYMONPAGEACKFONT
HTML tags designed to go in a <FONT> tag, to chose the font for
the acknowledgement text displayed on the status-log HTML page
for an acknowledged status.

.IP ACKUNTILMSG
When displaying the detailed status of an acknowledged test,
Xymon will include the time that the acknowledge expires
using the print-format defined in this setting. You can define
the timeformat using the controls in your systems
.I strftime(3)
routine, and add the text suitable for your setup.

.IP XYMONDATEFORMAT
On webpages generated by xymongen, the default header includes
the current date and time. Normally this looks like "Tue Aug 24
21:59:47 2004". The XYMONDATEFORMAT controls the format of this
timestamp - you can define the format using the controls in the 
.I strftime(3)
routine. E.g. to have it show up as "2004-08-24 21:59:47 +0200"
you would set XYMONDATEFORMAT="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z"

.IP HOLIDAYFORMAT
How holiday dates are displayed. The default is "%d/%m" which
show the day and month. American users may want to change this 
to "%m/%d" to suit their preferred date-display style. This
is a formatting string for the system
.I strftime(3)
routine, so any controls available for this routine may be used.

.IP XYMONPAGECOLREPEAT
Inspired by Jeff Stoner's col_repeat_patch.tgz patch, this defines
the maximum number of rows before repeating the column headings
on a webpage. This sets the default value for the 
.I xymongen(1)
"--maxrows" option; if the command-line option is also specifed,
then it overrides this environment variable. Note that unlike
Jeff's patch, xymongen implements this for both the "All non-green" 
page and all other pages (xymon.html, subpages, critical.html). 

.IP SUMMARY_SET_BKG
If set to TRUE, then summaries will affect the color of the
main Xymon webpage. Default: FALSE.

.IP DOTHEIGHT
The height (in pixels) of the icons showing the color of a status.
Default: 16, which matches the default icons.

.IP DOTWIDTH
The width (in pixels) of the icons showing the color of a status.
Default: 16, which matches the default icons.

.IP CLIENTSVCS
List of the status logs fed by data from the Xymon client. These
status logs will - if there are Xymon client data available for
the host - include a link to the raw data sent by the client.
Default: cpu,disk,memory,procs,svcs.

.IP XYMONRSSTITLE
If defined, this is the title of the RSS/RDF documents generated when
.I xymongen(1)
is invoked with the "--rss" option. The default value is "Xymon Alerts".

.IP WMLMAXCHARS
Maximum size of a WAP/WML output "card" when generating these.
Default: 1500.

.IP XYMONNONGREENEXT
List of scripts to run as extensions to the "All non-green" page. Note that
two scripts, "eventlog.sh" and "acklog.sh" are handled specially:
They are handled internally by xymongen, but the script names must
be listed in this variable for this function to be enabled.

.IP XYMONHISTEXT
List of scripts to run as extensions to a history page.

.IP XYMONREPWARN
Default threshold for listing the availability as "critical" (red) when
generating the availability report. This can be set on a per-host basis
with the WARNPCT setting in
.I hosts.cfg(5).
Default: 97 (percent)

.IP XYMONGENREPOPTS
Default xymongen options used for reports. This will typically include
such options as "--subpagecolumns", and also "--ignorecolumns" if 
you wish to exclude certain tests from reports by default.

.IP XYMONGENSNAPOPTS
Default xymongen options used by snapshots. This should be identical to
the options you normally used when building Xymon webpages.
