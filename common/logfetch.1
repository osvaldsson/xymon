.TH LOGFETCH 1 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
logfetch \- Xymon client data collector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "logfetch CONFIGFILE STATUSFILE"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlogfetch\fR is part of the Xymon client. It is responsible
for collecting data from logfiles, and other file-related data,
which is then sent to the Xymon server for analysis.

logfetch uses a configuration file, which is automatically
retrieved from the Xymon server. There is no configuration
done locally. The configuration file is usually stored in
the \fB$XYMONHOME/tmp/logfetch.cfg\fR file, but editing this file has
no effect since it is re-written with data from the Xymon 
server each time the client runs.

logfetch stores information about what parts of the monitored
logfiles have been processed already in the \fB$XYMONHOME/tmp/logfetch.status\fR 
file. This file is an internal file used by logfetch, and should
not be edited. If deleted, it will be re-created automatically.

.SH SECURITY
logfetch needs read access to the logfiles it should monitor. If you 
configure monitoring of files or directories through the "file:"
and "dir:" entries in 
.I client-local.cfg(5)
then logfetch will require at least read-acces to the directory
where the file is located. If you request checksum calculation
for a file, then it must be readable by the Xymon client user.

Do \fBNOT\fR install logfetch as suid-root. There is no
way that logfetch can check whether the configuration file it uses
has been tampered with, so installing logfetch with suid-root
privileges could allow an attacker to read any file on the system
by using a hand-crafted configuration file. In fact, logfetch will
attempt to remove its own suid-root setup if it detects that it
has been installed suid-root.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IP DU
Command used to collect information about the size of directories.
By default, this is the command \fBdu -k\fR. If the local
du-command on the client does not recognize the "-k" option,
you should set the DU environment variable in the 
\fB$XYMONHOME/etc/xymonclient.cfg\fR file to a command that
does report directory sizes in kilobytes.

.SH FILES
.IP $XYMONHOME/tmp/logfetch.cfg
