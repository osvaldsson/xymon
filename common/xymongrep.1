.TH XYMONGREP 1 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
xymongrep \- pick out lines in hosts.cfg
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "xymongrep --help"
.br
.B "xymongrep --version"
.br
.B "xymongrep [--noextras] [--test-untagged] [--web] [--net] TAG [TAG...]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I xymongrep(1)
is for use by extension scripts that need to pick out the entries 
in a hosts.cfg file that are relevant to the script.

The utility accepts test names as parameters, and will then
parse the hosts.cfg file and print out the host entries that
have at least one of the wanted tests specified. Tags may be
given with a trailing asterisk '*', e.g. "xymongrep http*"
is needed to find all http and https tags.

The xymongrep utility supports the use of "include" directives
inside the hosts.cfg file, and will find matching tags in all
included files.

If the DOWNTIME or SLA tags are used in the
.I hosts.cfg(5)
file, these are interpreted relative to the current time. 
xymongrep then outputs a "INSIDESLA" or "OUTSIDESLA" tag
for easier use by scripts that want to check if the current
time is inside or outside the expected uptime window.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--noextras"
Remove the "testip", "dialup", "INSIDESLA" and "OUTSIDESLA" tags 
from the output.

.IP "--test-untagged"
When using the XYMONNETWORK environment variable to test
only hosts on a particular network segment, xymonnet
will ignore hosts that do not have any "NET:x" tag.
So only hosts that have a NET:$XYMONNETWORK tag will be
tested.
.br
With this option, hosts with no NET: tag are included
in the test, so that all hosts that either have a
matching NET: tag, or no NET: tag at all are tested.

.IP "--no-down[=TESTNAME]"
xymongrep will query the Xymon server for the current
status of the "conn" test, and if TESTNAME is specified
also for the current state of the specified test. If
the status of the "conn" test for a host is non-green,
or the status of the TESTNAME test is disabled, then this 
host is ignored and will not be included in the output.
This can be used to ignore hosts that are down, or hosts
where the custom test is disabled.

.IP "--web"
Search the hosts.cfg file following include statements as a
Xymon web-server would.

.IP "--net"
Search the hosts.cfg file following include statements as 
when running xymonnet.

.SH EXAMPLE
If your hosts.cfg file looks like this

   192.168.1.1   www.test.com  # ftp telnet !oracle
   192.168.1.2   db1.test.com  # oracle
   192.168.1.3   mail.test.com # smtp

and you have a custom Xymon extension script that performs the
"oracle" test, then running "xymongrep oracle" would yield

   192.168.1.1   www.test.com  # !oracle
   192.168.1.2   db1.test.com  # oracle

so the script can quickly find the hosts that are of interest.

Note that the reverse-test modifier - "!oracle" - is included
in the output; this also applies to the other test modifiers
defined by Xymon (the dial-up and always-true modifiers).

If your extension scripts use more than one tag, just list
all of the interesting tags on the command line.

xymongrep also supports the "NET:location" tag used by 
xymonnet, so if your script performs network checks then 
it will see only the hosts that are relevant for the test
location that the script currently executes on.

.SH USE IN EXTENSION SCRIPTS
To integrate xymongrep into an existing script, look for
the line in the script that grep's in the $HOSTSCFG file. 
Typically it will look somewhat like this:

   $GREP -i "^[0-9].*#.*TESTNAME" $HOSTSCFG | ... code to handle test

Instead of the grep, we will use xymongrep. It then becomes

   $XYMONHOME/bin/xymongrep TESTNAME | ... code to handle test

which is simpler, less error-prone and more efficient.
