.TH XYMOND_DISTRIBUTE 8 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
xymond_distribute \- xymond worker module for distributing commands
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "xymond_channel --channel=enadis xymond_distribute [options]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
xymond_distribute is a worker module for xymond, and as such it is normally
run via the
.I xymond_channel(8)
program. It is used if you have multiple Xymon servers running in a
master/slave configuration. xymond_distribute runs on the master server and
receives "drop", "rename", "enable" and "disable" messages from xymond. 
xymond_distribute then forwards these to the other Xymon servers as standard 
xymon messages. So if a user on the master Xymon server disables a red status, 
xymond_distribute will forward this to the other Xymon servers so that the 
change happens everywhere.

NOTE: xymond_distribute does not check to see if a message has already been
forwarded, so you can easily create forwarding loops.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--peer=HOSTNAME"
The peer that messages are forwarded to. If you have multiple peers, repeat
this option.

.IP "--debug"
Enable debugging output.
