.TH XYMOND_HISTORY 8 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
xymond_history \- xymond worker module for logging status changes 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "xymond_channel --channel=stachg xymond_history [options]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
xymond_history is a worker module for xymond, and as such it is normally
run via the
.I xymond_channel(8)
program. It receives xymond status-change messages from the "stachg" 
channel via stdin, and uses these to update the history logfiles in a manner 
that is compatible with the standard Big Brother daemon, bbd.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--histdir=DIRECTORY"
The directory for the history files. If not specified, the
directory given by the XYMONHISTDIR environment is used.

.IP "--histlogdir=DIRECTORY"
The directory for the historical status-logs. If not specified, the
directory given by the XYMONHISTLOGS environment is used.

.IP "--minimum-free=N"
Sets the minimum percentage of free filesystem space on the $XYMONHISTLOGS
directory. If there is less than N% free space, xymond_history will
not save the detailed status-logs.
Default: 5

.IP "--pidfile=FILENAME"
xymond_history writes the process-ID it is running with to this file.
This is for use in automated startup scripts. The default file is
$XYMONSERVERLOGS/xymond_history.pid.

.IP "--debug"
Enable debugging output.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP XYMONALLHISTLOG
This environment variable controls if the $XYMONHISTDIR/allevents
logfile is updated. This file is used by the event-log display on the
nongreen html page and the eventlog-webpage, among other things. 
You can disable it by setting XYMONALLHISTLOGS=FALSE, but this is not
recommended.

.IP XYMONHOSTHISTLOG
This environment variable controls if the $XYMONHISTDIR/HOSTNAME
logfile is updated. This file holds a list of all status changes seen
for a single host, but is not used by any of the standard Xymon
tools. If you do not want to save this, you can disable it by setting
XYMONHOSTHISTLOG=FALSE.

.IP SAVESTATUSLOG
This environment variable controls if the historical
status-logs are saved whenever a status change occurs. These logfiles
are stored in the $XYMONHISTLOGS directory, and are used for the detailed
log-display of a status from the Xymon "History" page. If you
do not want to save these, you can disable it by setting SAVESTATUSLOG=FALSE.
If you want to save all except some specific logs, use SAVESTATUSLOG=TRUE,!TEST1[,!TEST2...]
If you want to save none except some specific logs, use SAVESTATUSLOG=FALSE,TEST1[,TEST2...]
.br
NOTE: Status logs will not be saved if there is less than 5% free space on 
the filesystem hosting the $XYMONHISTLOGS directory. The threshold can
be tuned via the "--minimum-free" option.

.SH FILES
This module does not rely on any configuration files.
