.TH XYMOND_HOSTDATA 8 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
xymond_hostdata \- xymond worker module for storing historical client data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "xymond_channel --channel=clichg xymond_hostdata"

.SH DESCRIPTION
xymond_hostdata is a worker module for xymond, and as such it is normally
run via the
.I xymond_channel(8)
program. Whenever a status column in Xymon changes to an alert
state (usually red, yellow or purple), this module receives a copy
of the latest Xymon client data sent by the host, and stores it on
disk. This allows you to review all of the data collected by the
Xymon client on the server around the time that a problem occurred.
This can make troubleshooting incidents easier by providing a snapshot
of the host status shortly before a problem became apparent.

Note: This module requires that
.I xymond(8)
is launched with the "--store-clientlogs" option enabled.

.SH OPTIONS

not save the data.

.SH FILES
All of the host data are stored in the $CLIENTLOGS directory,
by default this is the $XYMONVAR/hostdata/ directory.
