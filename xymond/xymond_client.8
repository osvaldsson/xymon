.TH XYMOND_CLIENT 8 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
xymond_client \- xymond worker module for client data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "xymond_channel --channel=client xymond_client [options]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
xymond_client is a worker module for xymond, and as such it is normally
run via the
.I xymond_channel(8)
program. It receives xymond client messages sent from systems that
have the the Xymon client installed, and use the client data to
generate the Xymon status messages for the cpu-, disk-, memory- and
procs-columns. It also feeds Xymon data messages with the netstat-
and vmstat-data collected by the client.

When generating these status messages from the client data, xymond_client
will use the configuration rules defined in the 
.I analysis.cfg(5)
file to determine the color of each status message.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--clear-color=COLOR"
Define the color used when sending "msgs", "files" or "ports" reports
and there are no rules to check for these statuses. The default is
to show a "clear" status, but some people prefer to have it "green".
If you would rather prefer not to see these status columns at all, then
you can use the "--no-clear-msgs", "--no-clear-files" and "--no-clear-ports"
options instead.

.IP "--no-clear-msgs"
If there are no logfile checks, the "msgs" column will show a "clear"
status. If you would rather avoid having a "msgs" column, this option
causes xymond_client to not send in a clear "msgs" status.

.IP "--no-clear-files"
If there are no file checks, the "files" column will show a "clear"
status. If you would rather avoid having a "files" column, this option
causes xymond_client to not send in a clear "files" status.

.IP "--no-clear-ports"
If there are no port checks, the "ports" column will show a "clear"
status. If you would rather avoid having a "ports" column, this option
causes xymond_client to not send in a clear "ports" status.

.IP "--no-ps-listing"
Normally the "procs" status message includes the full process-listing
received from the client. If you prefer to just have the monitored
processes shown, this option will turn off the full ps-listing.

.IP "--no-port-listing"
Normally the "ports" status message includes the full netstat-listing
received from the client. If you prefer to just have the monitored
ports shown, this option will turn off the full netstat-listing.

.IP "--config=FILENAME"
Sets the filename for the 
.I analysis.cfg
file. The default value is "etc/analysis.cfg" below the Xymon
server directory.

.IP "--dump-config"
Dumps the configuration after parsing it. May be useful to track
down problems with configuration file errors.

.IP "--test"
Starts an interactive session where you can test the analysis.cfg
configuration.

.IP "--collectors=COLLECTOR1[,COLLECTOR2,...]
Limit the set of collector modules that xymond_client will handle. This
is not normally used except for running experimental versions of the
program.

.IP "--debug"
Enable debugging output.
