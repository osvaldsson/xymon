.SH DESCRIPTION
xymond_filestore is a worker module for xymond, and as such it is normally
run via the
.I xymond_channel(8)
program. It receives xymond messages from a xymond channel via stdin, and 
stores these in the filesystem in a manner that is compatible with the 
Big Brother daemon, bbd.

This program can be started multiple times, if you want to store
messages for more than one channel.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--status"
Incoming messages are "status" messages, they will be stored in the
$XYMONRAWSTATUSDIR/ directory. If you are using 
.I xymon(7)
throughout your Xymon server, you will not need to run this
module to save status messages, unless you have a third-party 
add-on that reads the status-logs directly.
This module is NOT needed to get trend graphs, you should run the 
.I xymond_rrd(8)
module instead.

.IP "--data"
Incoming messages are "data" messages, they will be stored in the
$XYMONDATADIR directory. This module is not needed, unless you have a
third-party module that processes the data-files. This module is
NOT needed to get trend graphs, you should run the 
.I xymond_rrd(8)
module instead.

.IP "--notes"
Incoming messages are "notes" messages, they will be stored in the
$XYMONNOTESDIR directory. This modules is only needed if you want to 
allow people to remotely update the notes-files available on the
Xymon webpages.

.IP "--enadis"
Incoming messages are enable/disable messages, they will update 
files in the $XYMONDISABLEDDIR directory. This is only needed if you have
third-party add-ons that use these files.

.IP "--dir=DIRECTORY"
Overrides the default output directory.

.IP "--html"
Used together with "--status". Tells xymond_filestore to also save
an HTML version of the status-log. Should not be used unless you 
must run with "XYMONLOGSTATUS=static".

.IP "--htmldir=DIRECTORY"
The directory where HTML-versions of the status logs are stored.
Default: $XYMONHTMLSTATUSDIR

.IP "--htmlext=.EXT"
Set the filename extension for generated HTML files. By default, HTML
files are saved with a ".html" extension.

.IP "--multigraphs=TEST1[,TEST2]"
This causes xymond_filestore to generate HTML status pages with links to 
service graphs that are split up into multiple images, with at most 5 graphs
per image. If not specified, only the "disk" status is split up this way.

.IP "--only=test[,test,test]"
Save status messages only for the listed set of tests. This can be useful
if you have an external script that needs to parse some of the status logs,
but you do not want to save all status logs.

.IP "--debug"
Enable debugging output.

.SH FILES
This module does not rely on any configuration files.
