.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcombostatus\fR
is a Xymon extension script that runs on the Xymon server. 
It combines the results of one or more of the normal
Xymon test results into a combined test result, using
standard arithmetic og logical operators.

The resulting tests are sent to the Xymon display server as any 
normal test - so all of the standard Xymon functions (history,
statistics etc.) are available for the combined tests.

The tool was born from the need to monitor systems with built-in
redundancy and automatic failover - e.g. load-balanced web servers.
But other uses are possible.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--error-colors=COLOR[,COLOR]"
Specify which colors trigger an error status. By default only a "red" 
status counts as an error color - all other colors, including yellow,
will count as "green" when evaluating the combined status. COLOR
is "red", "yellow", "blue", "purple" or "clear".

.IP "--quiet"
Normally, the test status sent by combostatus includes information
about the underlying test results used to determine the current
value of the combined test. "--quiet" eliminates this information
from the test status page.

.IP "--debug"
Provide debugging output for use in troubleshooting problems with
combostatus.

.IP "--no-update"
Dont send any status messages - instead, the result of the combotests
is simply dumped to stdout. Useful for debugging.


.SH FILES
.IP $XYMONHOME/etc/combo.cfg
Configuration file for combostatus, where the combined tests are defined
.IP $XYMONHOME/etc/tasks.cfg
