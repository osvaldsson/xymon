.TH XYMONWEB 5 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
Xymon web page headers, footers and forms.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Xymon webpages are somewhat customizable, by modifying the header- and
footer-templates found in the ~xymon/server/web/ directory. There are usually
two or more files for a webpage: A \fBtemplate_header\fR file which is the
header for this webpage, and a \fBtemplate_footer\fR file which is the footer.
Webpages where entry forms are used have a \fBtemplate_form\fR file which is
the data-entry form.

With the exception of the \fBbulletin\fR files, the header files are inserted 
into the HTML code at the very beginning and the footer files are inserted at
the bottom.

The following templates are available:

.IP bulletin
A \fBbulletin_header\fR and \fBbulletin_footer\fR is not shipped with Xymon,
but if they exist then the content of these files will be inserted in all
HTML documents generated by Xymon. The "bulletin_header" contents will appear 
after the normal header for the webpage, and the "bulletin_footer" will appear
just before the normal footer for the webpage. These files can be used to
post important information about the Xymon system, e.g. to notify users of 
current operational or monitoring problems.
