.TH REPORTLOG.CGI 1 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
reportlog.cgi \- CGI program to report service availability log
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "reportlog.cgi"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBreportlog.cgi\fR
is invoked as a CGI script via the reportlog.sh CGI wrapper.
Based on the parameters it receives, it generates an
availability report for a specific host-service combination
for the requested time-period. The availability report 
includes a calculation of the availability percentage (split
out on percent green, yellow, red time), and an eventlog for
the period listing the status changes that have occurred to
allow for drill-down to the test reports that indicate a
problem. Access to the individual historical status logs
go via the
.I svcstatus.cgi(1)
CGI script.

reportlog.cgi is passed a QUERY_STRING environment variable 
with the following parameters:

   HOSTSVC (the host and service to report on)
   STYLE (report style: "crit", "non-crit", "all")
   ST (starttime in seconds since 1-1-1970 00:00 UTC)
   END (endtime in seconds since 1-1-1970 00:00 UTC)

The following non-standard parameters are handled by the
Xymon version of history.cgi:

   IP (IP address of host - for display purposes only)
   REPORTTIME (the REPORTTIME: setting for this host)
   WARNPCT (the WARNPCT: setting for this host)

The REPORTTIME and WARNPCT options are taken from the
.I hosts.cfg(5)
definition for the host, or the defaults are used. These
modify the availability calculation to handle reporting
against agreed Service Level Agreements re. the time of
day when the service must be available, and the agreed
availability level.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--env=FILENAME"
Loads environment from FILENAME before executing the CGI.
