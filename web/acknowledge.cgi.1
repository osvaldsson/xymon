.TH ACKNOWLEDGE.CGI 1 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
acknowledge.cgi \- Xymon CGI script to acknowledge alerts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "acknowledge.cgi?ACTION=action&NUMBER=acknum&DELAY=validity&MESSAGE=text"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBacknowledge.cgi\fR is invoked as a CGI script via the acknowledge.sh CGI wrapper.

acknowledge.cgi is passed a QUERY_STRING environment variable with the
ACTION, NUMBER, DELAY and MESSAGE parameters. 

.SH PARAMETERS
ACTION is the action to perform. The only supported action is "Ack" 
to acknowledge an alert.

NUMBER is the number identifying the host/service to be acknowledged.
It is included in all alert-messages sent out by Xymon.

DELAY is the time (in minutes) that the acknowledge is valid.

MESSAGE is an optional text which will be shown on the status page
while the acknowledgment is active. You can use it to e.g. tell users
not to contact you about the problem, or inform them when the problem
is expected to be resolved.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--no-pin"
acknowledge.cgi normally requires the user to enter the acknowledgment code
received in an alert message. If you run it with this option, the user
will instead get a list of the current non-green statuses, and he may
send an acknowledge without knowing the code.

.IP "--no-cookies"
Normally, acknowledge.cgi uses a cookie sent by the browser to initially 
filter the list of hosts presented. If this is not desired, you can
turn off this behaviour by calling acknowledge.cgi with the --no-cookies
option. This would normally be placed in the CGI_ACK_OPTS setting in
.I cgioptions.cfg(5)

.IP "--env=FILENAME"
Loads the environment defined in FILENAME before executing the CGI script.

.IP "--debug"
Enables debugging output.

.SH FILES
.IP "$XYMONHOME/web/acknowledge_header"
HTML header file for the generated web page

.IP "$XYMONHOME/web/acknowledge_footer"
HTML footer file for the generated web page

.IP "$XYMONHOME/web/acknowledge_form"
Query form displayed when acknowledge.cgi is called with no parameters.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IP XYMONHOME
Used to locate the template files for the generated web pages.

.IP QUERY_STRING
Contains the parameters for the CGI script.

.SH BUGS
When using alternate pagesets, hosts will only show up on the
acknowledgment page if this is accessed from the primary page
in which they are defined. So if you have hosts on multiple
pages, they will only be visible for acknowledging from their
main page which is not what you would expect.
