.TH XYMON-WEBACCESS 5 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
xymon-webaccess \- Web-based access controls in Xymon

.SH DESCRIPTION
Xymon does not provide any built-in authentication (login) mechanism.
Instead, it relies on the access controls available in your web server,
e.g. the Apache \fBmod_auth\fR modules.

This provides a simple way of controlling access to the physical
directories that make up the pages and subpages with the hosts
defined in your Xymon
.I hosts.cfg(5)
setup - you can use the Apache "require" setting to allow or deny
access to information on any page, usually through the use of a
"Require group ..." setting. The group name then refers to one
or more groups in an Apache \fBAuthGroupFile\fR file.

However, this does not work for the Xymon CGI programs since they 
are used to fetch information about all hosts in Xymon, but there
is only a single directory holding all of the CGI's. So here you
can only require that the user is logged-in (the Apache "Require valid-user"
directive). A user with a login can - if he knows the hostname - 
manipulate the request sent to the webserver and fetch information
about any status by use of the Xymon CGI programs, even though he
cannot see the overview webpages.

To alleviate this situation, the following Xymon CGI's support a
"--access=FILENAME" option, where FILENAME is an Apache compatible
group-definitions file:
.br
.I svcstatus.cgi(1)
.br
.I acknowledge.cgi(1)
.br
.I enadis.cgi(1)
.br
.I appfeed.cgi(1)

When invoked with this option the CGI will read the Apache
group-definitions file, and assume that an Apache \fBgroup\fR
maps to a Xymon \fBpage\fR, and then - based on the logged-in userid - 
determine which pages and hosts the user is allowed access to.
Only information about those hosts will be made available by the CGI
tool.

Members of the group \fBroot\fR has access to all hosts.

Access will also be granted, if the user is a member of a group
with the same name as the \fBhost\fR being requested, or as the
\fBstatuscolumn\fR being requested.
