.TH APPFEED.CGI 1 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
appfeed.cgi \- Xymon CGI feeder for Smartphone apps
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "appfeed.cgi [options]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBappfeed.cgi\fR
is invoked as a CGI script via the appfeed.sh CGI wrapper.

appfeed.cgi is optionally passed a QUERY_STRING environment variable with the
"filter=FILTER" parameter. FILTER is a filter for the "xymondboard" command
sent to
.I xymond(8)
daemon. These filters are described in detail in the
.I xymon(1)
manual. Typically, the filter will specify hosts found on a specific (sub)page
to be returned, e.g. "filter=page=webservers" will cause appfeed.cgi to only 
return hosts that are present on the "webservers" page in Xymon.

If no filter is specified, appfeed.cgi returns data for all red, yellow or purple
statuses (equivalent to the data present on the "All non-green" page), or if invoked 
with the "--critical" option it returns data from the "Critical systems" page.

The output is an XML document with the current status of the selected hosts/services.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--env=FILENAME
Loads the environment from FILENAME before executing the CGI.

.IP "--critical[=FILENAME]"
FILENAME specifies the "Critical Systems" configuration file (default: critical.cfg).
appfeed.cgi will only return the statuses currently on the "Critical Systems" view.

.IP "--access=FILENAME"
In addition to the filtering done by the "filter" parameter or the "--critical" option,
this option limits the output to hosts that the user has access to as defined in the
Apache-compatible group-definitions in FILENAME. See
.I xymon-webaccess(5)
for more details of this.
.BR
Note: Use of this option requires that access to the appfeed.cgi tool is password-protected
by whatever means your webserver software provides, and that the login userid is available
via the REMOTE_USER environment variable (this is standard CGI behaviour, so all webservers
should provide it if you use the webserver's built-in authentication mechanisms).
