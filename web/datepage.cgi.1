.TH DATEPAGE.CGI 1 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
datepage.cgi \- Xymon CGI script to view pre-built reports by date
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "datepage.cgi?type={day,week,month} --url=URLPREFIX [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdatepage.cgi\fR is invoked as a CGI script via the datepage.sh CGI wrapper.

datepage.cgi is passed a QUERY_STRING environment variable with the
type of time-selection that is desired: Either "day", "week" or "month"
can be requested. It will then generate a web form with appropriate
day/week/month selection boxes, and based on the users' selection a
resulting url is built from the URLPREFIX and the time selection.
The browser is then redirected to this URL.

The URL is constructed from the URLPREFIX, the type-parameter, the 
value of the "pagepath" or "host" cookie, and the users' selection 
as follows:

.IP type=day
The final URL is \fBURLPREFIX/daily/YEAR/MONTH/DAY/PAGEPATH\fR.

.IP type=week
The final URL is \fBURLPREFIX/weekly/YEAR/WEEK/PAGEPATH\fR.

.IP type=month
The final URL is \fBURLPREFIX/monthly/YEAR/MONTH/PAGEPATH\fR.

YEAR is the full year (4 digits, including century). MONTH is the
two-digit number of the month (01..12). DAY is the number of the 
day in the month (01..31). WEEK is the ISO 8601:1988 week-number 
(01..53). PAGEPATH is the current value of the "pagepath" cookie
if set; if it is not set but the "host" cookie is set, then this
host is looked up in the hosts.cfg file and the page where this host
is found is used for PAGEPATH. These two cookies are set by the 
default web-header templates supplied with Xymon.
