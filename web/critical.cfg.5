.TH CRITICAL.CFG 5 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
critical.cfg \- Configuration of the showgraph CGI

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B $XYMONHOME/etc/critical.cfg

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I critical.cgi(1)
uses the configuration file $XYMONHOME/etc/critical.cfg to
determine which of the statuses currently in a red or yellow state
should appear on the Critical Systems view.

This file should not be edited manually. It is maintained by the
.I criticaleditor.cgi(1)
utility via a web-based frontend.

.SH FILE PERMISSIONS
Since the file is maintained by a web front-end tool, the userid
running Web CGI scripts must have write-permission to the file.
Typically, this means it must have a group-ownership matching your
webserver userid, and group-write permissions (mode 664).

When editing the file with the web front-end, a backup file is created.
Therefore the critical.cfg.bak file should have identical permissions.
