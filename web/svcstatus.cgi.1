.TH SVCSTATUS.CGI 1 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
svcstatus.cgi \- CGI program to view Xymon status logs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "svcstatus.cgi [--historical] [--history={top|bottom}]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsvcstatus.cgi\fR
is a CGI program to present a Xymon status log in HTML 
form (ie, as a web page). It can be used both for the logs
showing the current status, and for historical logs from the
"histlogs" directory. It is normally invoked as a
CGI program, and therefore receives most of the input parameters
via the CGI QUERY_STRING environment variable.

Unless the "--historical" option is present, the current status log
is used. This assumes a QUERY_STRING environment variable of the form
.br
   HOSTSVC=hostname.servicename
.br
where "hostname" is the name of the host with commas instead of dots,
and "servicename" is the name of the service (the column name in Xymon). 
Such links are automatically generated by the
.I xymongen(1)
tool when the environment contains "XYMONLOGSTATUS=dynamic".

With the "--historical" option present, a historical logfile is
used. This assumes a QUERY_STRING environment variable of the form
.br
   HOST=hostname&SERVICE=servicename&TIMEBUF=timestamp
.br
where "hostname" is the name of the host with commas instead of dots,
"servicename" is the name of the service, and "timestamp" is the time
of the log. This is automatically generated by the
.I history.cgi(1)
tool.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--historical"
Use a historical logfile instead of the current logfile.

.IP "--history={top|bottom|none}"
When showing the current logfile, provide a "HISTORY" button
at the top or the bottom of the webpage, or not at all. The default 
is to put the HISTORY button at the bottom of the page.

.IP "--env=FILENAME"
Load the environment from FILENAME before executing the CGI.

.IP "--templates=DIRECTORY"
Where to look for the HTML header- and footer-templates used
when generating the webpages. Default: $XYMONHOME/web/

.IP "--no-svcid"
Do not include the HTML tags to identify the hostname/service
on the generated web page. Useful is this already happens in 
the hostsvc_header template file, for instance.

.IP "--multigraphs=TEST1[,TEST2]"
This causes svcstatus.cgi to generate links to service graphs 
that are split up into multiple images, with at most 5 graphs
per image. This option only works in Xymon mode. If not
specified, only the "disk" status is split up this way.

.IP "--no-disable"
By default, the info-column page includes a form allowing users 
to disable and re-enable tests. If your setup uses the default
separation of administration tools into a separate, password-
protected area, then use of the disable- and enable-functions
requires access to the administration tools. If you prefer to 
do this only via the dedicated administration page, this option
will remove the disable-function from the info page.

.IP "--no-jsvalidation"
The disable-function on the info-column page by default uses
JavaScript to validate the form before submitting the input
to the Xymon server. However, some browsers cannot handle the
Javascript code correctly so the form does not work. This 
option disables the use of Javascript for form-validation,
allowing these browsers to use the disable-function.

.IP "--nkconfig=FILENAME"
Use FILENAME as the configuration file for the Critical 
Systems information. The default is to load this from
$XYMONHOME/etc/critical.cfg

.SH FILES
.IP "$XYMONHOME/web/hostsvc_header"
HTML template header

.IP "$XYMONHOME/web/hostsvc_footer"
HTML template footer

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP "NONHISTS=info,trends,graphs"
A comma-separated list of services that does not have meaningful
history, e.g. the "info" and "trends" columns. Services listed here
do not get a "History" button.

.IP "TEST2RRD=test,test"
A comma-separated list of the tests that have an RRD graph.
