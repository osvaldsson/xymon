xymon - Xymon client communication program
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>xymon [options] RECIPIENT message</B>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I><A HREF="../man1/xymon.1.html">xymon</A>(1)</I>

is the client program used to communicate with a
Xymon server. It is frequently used by Xymon
client systems to send in status messages and pager
alerts on local tests.
<P>
In Xymon, the xymon program is also used for administrative
purposes, e.g. to rename or delete hosts, or to disable
hosts that are down for longer periods of time.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS AND PARAMETERS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--debug<DD>
Enable debugging. This prints out details about how the
connection to the Xymon server is being established.
<P>
<DT>--proxy=<A HREF="http://PROXYSERVER:PROXYPORT/">http://PROXYSERVER:PROXYPORT/</A><DD>
When sending the status messages via HTTP, use this server
as an HTTP proxy instead of connecting directly to the Xymon
server.
<P>
<DT>--timeout=N<DD>
Specifies the timeout for connecting to the Xymon server, in
seconds. The default is 5 seconds.
<P>
<DT>--response<DD>
The xymon utility normally knows when to expect a response 
from the server, so this option is not required. However,
it will cause any response from the server to be displayed.
<P>
<DT>--merge<DD>
Merge the command line message text with the data provided
on standard input, and send the result to the Xymon server.
The message text provided on the command line becomes the
first line of the merged message.
<P>
<DT>RECIPIENT<DD>
The <B>RECIPIENT</B> parameter defines which server receives
the message. If RECIPIENT is given as &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, then the
message is sent to all of the servers listed in the XYMSERVERS
environment variable.
<P>
Usually, a client will use &quot;$XYMSRV&quot; for the <B>RECIPIENT</B> 
parameter, as this is defined for the client scripts
to automatically contain the correct value.
<P>
The <B>RECIPIENT</B> parameter may be a URL for a webserver
that has the xymoncgimsg.cgi or similar script installed. This
tunnels the Xymon messages to the Xymon server using standard 
HTTP protocol. The 
<I><A HREF="../man8/xymoncgimsg.cgi.8.html">xymoncgimsg.cgi</A>(8)</I>

CGI tool (included in Xymon) must be installed on the webserver 
for the HTTP transport to work.
<BR>

<P>
<DT>MESSAGE<DD>
The <B>message</B> parameter is the message to be sent across
to the Xymon server. Messages must be enclosed in quotes,
but by doing so they can span multiple lines. The maximum size
of a message is defined by the maximum allowed length of your
shell's command-line, and is typically 8-32 KB. 
<P>
If you need to send longer status messages, you can specify &quot;@&quot; 
as the message: xymon will then read the status message from its
stdin.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>XYMON MESSAGE SYNTAX</H2>

<P>
This section lists the most commonly used messages in the Xymon
protocol.
<P>
Each message must begin with one of the Xymon commands. Where
a HOSTNAME is specified, it must have any dots in the hostname changed
to commas if the Xymon FQDN setting is enabled (which is the default).
So the host &quot;<A HREF="http://www.foo.com">www.foo.com</A>&quot;, for example, would report as &quot;www,foo,com&quot;.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>status[+LIFETIME][/group:GROUP] HOSTNAME.TESTNAME COLOR &lt;additional text&gt;<DD>
This sends in a status message for a single test (column) on a single host.
TESTNAME is the name of the column where this test will show up; any
name is valid except that using dots in the testname will not work.
COLOR must be one of the valid colors: &quot;green&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;red&quot; or &quot;clear&quot;.
The colors &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;purple&quot; - although valid colors - should not be sent in a
status message, as these are handled specially by the Xymon server.
As a special case (for supporting older clients), &quot;client&quot; can be
used as the name of the color. This causes the status message to be
handled by Xymon as a &quot;client&quot; data message, and the TESTNAME
parameter is used as the &quot;collector id&quot;.
<BR>

The &quot;additional text&quot; normally includes a local timestamp and a summary
of the test result on the first line. Any lines following the first one
are free-form, and can include any information that may be useful to
diagnose the problem being reported.
<BR>

The LIFETIME defines how long this status is valid after being received
by the Xymon server. The default is 30 minutes, but you can set any
period you like. E.g. for a custom test that runs once an hour, you will
want to set this to at least 60 minutes - otherwise the status will go
purple after 30 minutes. It is a good idea to set the LIFETIME to
slightly longer than the interval between your tests, to allow for variations
in the time it takes your test to complete. The LIFETIME is in minutes,
unless you add an &quot;h&quot; (hours), &quot;d&quot; (days) or &quot;w&quot; (weeks) immediately after
the number, e.g. &quot;status+5h&quot; for a status that is valid for 5 hours.
<BR>

The GROUP option is used to direct alerts from the status to a specific group.
It is currently used for status generated from the Xymon clients' data,
e.g. to direct alerts for a &quot;procs&quot; status to different people, depending on
exactly which process is down.
<P>
<DT>notify HOSTNAME.TESTNAME &lt;message text&gt;<DD>
This triggers an informational message to be sent to those who 
receive alerts for this HOSTNAME+TESTNAME combination, 
according to the rules defined in
<I><A HREF="../man5/alerts.cfg.5.html">alerts.cfg</A>(5)</I>

This is used by the 
<I><A HREF="../man1/enadis.cgi.1.html">enadis.cgi</A>(1)</I>

tool to notify people about hosts being disabled or 
enabled, but can also serve as a general way of notifying 
server administrators.
<P>
<DT>data HOSTNAME.DATANAME&lt;newline&gt;&lt;additional text&gt;<DD>
The &quot;data&quot; message allows tools to send data about a host, without
it appearing as a column on the Xymon webpages. This
is used, for example, to report statistics about a host, e.g. vmstat data, which
does not in itself represent something that has a red, yellow or
green identity. It is used by RRD bottom-feeder modules, among
others. In Xymon, data messages are by default processed only by the
<I><A HREF="../man8/xymond_rrd.8.html">xymond_rrd</A>(8)</I>

module. If you want to handle data-messages using an external application,
you may want to enable the 
<I><A HREF="../man8/xymond_filestore.8.html">xymond_filestore</A>(8)</I>

module for data-messages, to store data-messages in a format compatible
with how the Big Brother daemon does.
<P>
<DT>disable HOSTNAME.TESTNAME DURATION &lt;additional text&gt;<DD>
Disables a specific test for DURATION minutes. This will cause the
status of this test to be listed as &quot;blue&quot; on the Xymon server,
and no alerts for this host/test will be generated. If DURATION is
given as a number followed by s/m/h/d, it is interpreted as being
in seconds/minutes/hours/days respectively.

To disable a test until it becomes OK, use &quot;-1&quot; as the DURATION.

To disable all tests for a host, use an asterisk &quot;*&quot; for TESTNAME.
<P>
<DT>enable HOSTNAME.TESTNAME<DD>
Re-enables a test that had been disabled.
<P>
<DT>query HOSTNAME.TESTNAME<DD>
Query the Xymon server for the latest status reported for this
particular test. If the host/test status is known, the response is
the first line of the status report - the current color will be the
first word on the line. Additional lines of text that might be 
present on the status message cannot be retrieved.
<BR>

This allows any Xymon client to determine the status of a particular
test, whether it is one pertaining to the host where the client
is running, some other host, or perhaps the result of a combined
test from multiple hosts managed by
<I><A HREF="../man1/combostatus.1.html">combostatus</A>(1)</I>

This will typically be useful to Xymon client extension scripts, that
need to determine the status of other hosts, for example, to decide if an
automatic recovery action should be initiated.
<P>
<DT>config FILENAME<DD>
Retrieve one of the Xymon configuration files from the
server. This command allows a client to pull files from the
$XYMONHOME/etc/ directory on the server, allowing for semi-automatic
updates of the client configuration. Since the configuration files 
are designed to have a common file for the configuration of all hosts 
in the system - and this is in fact the recommended way of configuring 
your clients - this makes it easier to keep the configuration 
files synchronized.
<P>
<DT>drop HOSTNAME<DD>
Removes all data stored about the host HOSTNAME. It is assumed that you
have already deleted the host from the hosts.cfg configuration file.
<P>
<DT>drop HOSTNAME TESTNAME<DD>
Remove data about a single test (column).
<P>
<DT>rename OLDHOSTNAME NEWHOSTNAME<DD>
Rename all data for a host that has had its name changed. You should do this
after changing the hostname in the hosts.cfg configuration file.
<P>
<DT>rename HOSTNAME OLDTESTNAME NEWTESTNAME<DD>
Rename data about a single test (column).
<P>
<DT>xymondlog HOSTNAME.TESTNAME<DD>
Retrieve the Xymon status-log for a single test. The first line of the
response contains a series of fields separated by a pipe-sign:
<P>
<B>hostname</B>

Newline, pipe-signs and backslashes are escaped with a backslash, C-style.
<P>
After the first line comes the full status log in plain text format.
<P>
<DT>xymondxlog HOSTNAME.TESTNAME<DD>
Retrieves an XML string containing the status log as with the 
&quot;xymondlog&quot; command.
<P>
<DT>xymondboard [CRITERIA] [fields=FIELDLIST]<DD>
Retrieves a summary of the status of all known tests available to
the Xymon daemon. 
<P>
By default - if no CRITERIA is provided - it returns one line for all 
status messages that are found in Xymon. You can filter the response
by selecting a page, a host, a test or a color - the PAGEPATH, HOSTNAME
and TESTNAME parameters are interpreted as regular expressions, the COLOR 
parameter accepts multiple colors separated by comma.
<P>
<B>page=PAGEPATH</B>

Include only tests from hosts found on the PAGEPATH page in the hosts.cfg
file.
<P>
<B>host=HOSTNAME</B>

Include only tests from the host HOSTNAME
<P>
<B>test=TESTNAME</B>

Include only tests with the testname TESTNAME
<P>
<B>color=COLORNAME</B>

Include only tests where the status color is COLORNAME
<P>
You can filter on, for example, both a hostname and a testname. 
<P>
The response is one line for each status that matches the CRITERIA,
or all statuses if no criteria is specified. The line is composed of
a number of fields, separated by a pipe-sign. You can select which
fields to retrieve by listing them in the FIELDLIST. The following
fields are available:

was generated and when it expires; the the &quot;ack level&quot;; the user who sent the ack; and 
the acknowledgement text.
<P>
<B>flapinfo</B>

Tells if the status is flapping. 5 fields, delimited by &quot;/&quot;: A &quot;0&quot; if the status
is not flapping and &quot;1&quot; if it is flapping; timestamp when the latest status change

<I><A HREF="../man5/hosts.cfg.5.html">hosts.cfg</A>(5)</I>

configuration settings. A full list of these can be found in the
<I><A HREF="../man5/xymon-xmh.5.html">xymon-xmh</A>(5)</I>

man-page.
<P>
The ackmsg, dismsg and msg fields have certain characters encoded: Newline
is &quot;\n&quot;, TAB is &quot;\t&quot;, carriage return is &quot;\r&quot;, a pipe-sign is &quot;\p&quot;, 
and a backslash is &quot;\\&quot;.
<P>
If the &quot;fields&quot; parameter is omitted, a default set of

as for the &quot;xymondboard&quot; command.
<P>
<DT>download FILENAME<DD>
Download a file from the Xymon server's download directory.
<P>
<DT>client[/COLLECTORID] HOSTNAME.OSTYPE [HOSTCLASS]<DD>
Used to send a &quot;client&quot; message to the Xymon server. Client messages
are generated by the Xymon client; when sent to the Xymon server they
are matched against the rules in the
<I><A HREF="../man5/analysis.cfg.5.html">analysis.cfg</A>(5)</I>

configuration file, and status messages are generated for the client-side
tests.
The COLLECTORID is used when sending client-data that are additions
to the standard client data. The data will be concatenated with the
normal client data.
<P>
<DT>clientlog HOSTNAME [section=SECTIONNAME[,SECTIONNAME...]]<DD>
Retrieves the current raw client message last sent by HOSTNAME. The optional
&quot;section&quot; filter is used to select specific sections of the client data.
<P>
<DT>ping<DD>
Attempts to contact the Xymon server. If successful, the Xymon server version ID
is reported.
<P>
<DT>pullclient<DD>
This message is used when fetching client data via the &quot;pull&quot; mechanism implemented by
<I><A HREF="../man8/xymonfetch.8.html">xymonfetch</A>(8)</I>

and
<I><A HREF="../man8/msgcache.8.html">msgcache</A>(8)</I>

for clients that cannot connect directly to the Xymon server.
<P>
<DT>ghostlist<DD>
Report a list of <B>ghost</B> clients seen by the Xymon server. Ghosts are systems
that report data to the Xymon server, but are not listed in the hosts.cfg file.
<P>
<DT>schedule [TIMESTAMP COMMAND]<DD>
Schedules a command sent to the Xymon server for execution at a later time. E.g.
used to schedule disabling of a host or service at sometime in the future. COMMAND
is a complete Xymon command such as the ones listed above. TIMESTAMP is the
Unix epoch time when the command will be executed.
<BR>

If no parameters are given, the currently scheduled tasks are listed in the response.
The response is one line per scheduled command, with the job-id, the time when the
command will be executed, the IP address from which this was sent, and the full command
string.
<BR>

To cancel a previously scheduled command, <B>&quot;schedule cancel JOBID&quot;</B> can be
used. JOBID is a number provided as the first item in the output from the schedule list.
<P>
<DT>notes FILENAME<DD>
The message text will be stored in $XYMONHOME/notes/FILENAME which is then used as
hyperlinks from hostnames or column names. This requires that the &quot;storenotes&quot; 
task is enabled in tasks.cfg (it is disabled by default). FILENAME 
cannot contain any directory path - these are stripped automatically.
<P>
<DT>usermsg ID<DD>
These messages will be relayed directly to modules listening on the &quot;user&quot;
channel of the Xymon daemon. This is intended for custom communication
between client-side modules and the Xymon server.
<P>
<DT>modify HOSTNAME.TESTNAME COLOR SOURCE CAUSE<DD>
Modify the color of a specific status, without generating a complete
status message. This is for backend processors (e.g. RRD graphs)
that can override the color of a status based on some criteria
determined outside the normal flow of a status. E.g. the normal
&quot;conn&quot; status may appear to be green since it merely checks on
whether a host can be ping'ed or not; the RRD handler can then
use a &quot;modify&quot; command to override this is the actual ping
responsetime exceeds a given threshold. (See the &quot;DS&quot; configuration
setting in 
<I><A HREF="../man5/analysis.cfg.5.html">analysis.cfg</A>(5)</I>

for how to do this). SOURCE is some identification of the module
that generates the &quot;modify&quot; message - future modifications must
use the same source. There may be several sources that modify
the same status (the most severe status then becomes the actual
color of the status). CAUSE is a one-line text string explaining
the reason for overriding the normal status color - it will be
displayed on the status webpage.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

<P>
Send a normal status message to the Xymon server, using the
standard Xymon protocol on TCP port 1984:
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;$XYMON&nbsp;$XYMSRV&nbsp;&quot;status&nbsp;www,foo,com.http&nbsp;green&nbsp;`date`&nbsp;Web&nbsp;OK&quot;
<P>
Send the same status message, but using HTTP protocol via the
webserver's xymoncgimsg.cgi script:
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;$XYMON&nbsp;<A HREF="http://bb.foo.com/cgi-bin/xymoncgimsg.cgi">http://bb.foo.com/cgi-bin/xymoncgimsg.cgi</A>&nbsp;&quot;status&nbsp;www,foo,com.http&nbsp;green&nbsp;`date`&nbsp;Web&nbsp;OK&quot;
<P>
Use &quot;query&quot; message to determine the color of the &quot;www&quot; test, and
restart Apache if it is red:
<BR>

<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;WWW=`$XYMON&nbsp;$XYMSRV&nbsp;&quot;query&nbsp;www,foo,com.www&quot;&nbsp;|&nbsp;awk&nbsp;'{print&nbsp;$1}'`
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;if&nbsp;[&nbsp;&quot;$WWW&quot;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&quot;red&quot;&nbsp;];&nbsp;then&nbsp;/etc/init.d/apache&nbsp;restart;&nbsp;fi
<P>
Use &quot;config&quot; message to update a local mytest.cfg file (but only
if we get a response):
<BR>

<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;$XYMON&nbsp;$XYMSRV&nbsp;&quot;config&nbsp;mytest.cfg&quot;&nbsp;&gt;/tmp/mytest.cfg.new
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;if&nbsp;[&nbsp;-s&nbsp;/tmp/mytest.cfg.new&nbsp;];&nbsp;then&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mv&nbsp;/tmp/mytest.cfg.new&nbsp;$XYMONHOME/etc/mytest.cfg
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fi
<P>
Send a very large status message that has been built in the
file &quot;statusmsg.txt&quot;. Instead of providing it on the command-line, 
pass it via stdin to the xymon command:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;cat&nbsp;statusmsg.txt&nbsp;|&nbsp;$XYMON&nbsp;$XYMSRV&nbsp;&quot;@&quot;
