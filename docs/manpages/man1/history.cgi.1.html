history.cgi - CGI program to display service history
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>history.cgi</B>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>history.cgi</B>
is invoked as a CGI script via the history.sh CGI wrapper.
It is passed a QUERY_STRING environment variable with the
following parameters:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HISTFILE&nbsp;(a&nbsp;Xymon&nbsp;service&nbsp;history&nbsp;file)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENTRIES&nbsp;(the&nbsp;number&nbsp;of&nbsp;entries&nbsp;to&nbsp;show)
<BR>&nbsp;
The following non-standard parameters are handled by the
Xymon version of history.cgi:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IP&nbsp;(IP&nbsp;address&nbsp;of&nbsp;host&nbsp;-&nbsp;for&nbsp;display&nbsp;purposes&nbsp;only)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PIXELS&nbsp;(width&nbsp;of&nbsp;colorbar&nbsp;when&nbsp;in&nbsp;pixel-mode)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENDTIME&nbsp;(when&nbsp;the&nbsp;colorbar&nbsp;begins,&nbsp;a&nbsp;time_t&nbsp;value)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BARSUMS&nbsp;(which&nbsp;colorbars&nbsp;and&nbsp;summaries&nbsp;to&nbsp;show)
<P>
history.cgi analyses the service history file for changes that have
occurred within the past 24 hours, and build a colorbar
showing the status of the service over this period of time.
A statistics summary is also produced, listing the amount
of time for each status (green, yellow, red, purple, blue, clear).
<P>
Finally, a summary of the last N events is given, with links to
the actual event logs.
<P>
Unlike the standard history.sh script, history.cgi provides 
a colorbar and statistics summaries also covering the past 
1 week, 4 weeks and 1 year of data. Via links it is possible 
to browse the entire history of the service at the requested
interval.
<P>
Note that since the resolution of the display is limited,
events may be too short to show up on a colorbar; also,
the exact placement of an event may not fully match up 
with the time-markers.
<P>
The graphs should correctly handle the display of months
with different number of days, as well as the display of
periods that involve beginning and end of Daylight Savings
Time, if this occurs in your timezone.
<P>
All dates and times shown are in local time for the timezone
defined on the Xymon server.

<H2>PARAMETERS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>HISTFILE<DD>
Defines the host and service whose history is presented.
<DT>ENTRIES<DD>
The number of log-entries to show in the event log table.
Default is 50; to view all log entries set this to &quot;ALL&quot;.
<DT>IP<DD>
The IP-address of the host. This is only used for the title
of the document.
<DT>PIXELS<DD>
The width of the colorbar graph in pixels. If this is
set to 0, a percentage-based graph will be shown, similar
to the one provided by the standard history.sh script.
Pixel-based graphs can have a higher resolution, but do
not resize automatically to suit the size of a browser 
window. The default value for this parameter is defined
at compile-time; 960 is a good value for displays with
a 1024x768 resolution.
<DT>BARSUMS<DD>
Defines which colorbars and summaries to show. This is
a number made up from a bitmask. The 1-day graph uses the
value &quot;1&quot;; the 1-week graph uses the value &quot;2&quot;; the 4-week
graph uses the value &quot;4&quot; and the 1-year graph the value &quot;8&quot;.
To show multiple graph, add the values - e.g. &quot;6&quot; will show
the 1-week and 4-weeks graphs, whereas &quot;15&quot; will show all
the graphs. The default is defined at compile-time.
<DT>ENDTIME<DD>
The history display by default ends with the current time.
Setting the ENDTIME parameter causes it to end at the time
specified - this is given as a Unix &quot;time_t&quot; value, i.e.
as the number of seconds elapsed since Jan 1 1970 00:00 UTC.
