logfetch - Xymon client data collector

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>logfetch CONFIGFILE STATUSFILE</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>logfetch</B> is part of the Xymon client. It is responsible
for collecting data from logfiles, and other file-related data,
which is then sent to the Xymon server for analysis.
<P>
logfetch uses a configuration file, which is automatically
retrieved from the Xymon server. There is no configuration
done locally. The configuration file is usually stored in
the <B>$XYMONHOME/tmp/logfetch.cfg</B> file, but editing this file has
no effect since it is re-written with data from the Xymon 
server each time the client runs.
<P>
logfetch stores information about what parts of the monitored
logfiles have been processed already in the <B>$XYMONHOME/tmp/logfetch.status</B> 
file. This file is an internal file used by logfetch, and should
not be edited. If deleted, it will be re-created automatically.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SECURITY</H2>

logfetch needs read access to the logfiles it should monitor. If you 
configure monitoring of files or directories through the &quot;file:&quot;
and &quot;dir:&quot; entries in 
<I><A HREF="../man5/client-local.cfg.5.html">client-local.cfg</A>(5)</I>

then logfetch will require at least read-acces to the directory
where the file is located. If you request checksum calculation
for a file, then it must be readable by the Xymon client user.
<P>
Do <B>NOT</B> install logfetch as suid-root. There is no
way that logfetch can check whether the configuration file it uses
has been tampered with, so installing logfetch with suid-root
privileges could allow an attacker to read any file on the system
by using a hand-crafted configuration file. In fact, logfetch will
attempt to remove its own suid-root setup if it detects that it
has been installed suid-root.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>DU<DD>
Command used to collect information about the size of directories.
By default, this is the command <B>du -k</B>. If the local
du-command on the client does not recognize the &quot;-k&quot; option,
you should set the DU environment variable in the 
<B>$XYMONHOME/etc/xymonclient.cfg</B> file to a command that
does report directory sizes in kilobytes.
