<H2>NAME</H2>

analysis.cfg - Configuration file for the xymond_client module
<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>~Xymon/server/etc/analysis.cfg</B>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The analysis.cfg file controls what color is assigned to
the status-messages that are generated from the Xymon client
data - typically the cpu, disk, memory, procs- and msgs-columns. Color
is decided on the basis of some <B>settings</B> defined in this file;
settings apply to specific hosts through a set of <B>rules</B>.
<P>
Note: This file is only used on the Xymon server - it is not
used by the Xymon client, so there is no need to distribute
it to your client systems.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILE FORMAT</H2>

Blank lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are treated as 
comments and ignored. 
<P>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CPU STATUS COLUMN SETTINGS</H2>

<P>
<B>LOAD warnlevel paniclevel</B>

<P>
If the system load exceeds &quot;warnlevel&quot; or &quot;paniclevel&quot;, the &quot;cpu&quot;
status will go yellow or red, respectively. These are decimal
numbers.
<P>
Defaults: warnlevel=5.0, paniclevel=10.0
<P>
<B>UP bootlimit toolonglimit [color]</B>

<P>
The cpu status goes yellow/red if the system has been up for less than
&quot;bootlimit&quot; time, or longer than &quot;toolonglimit&quot;. The time is in
minutes, or you can add h/d/w for hours/days/weeks - eg. &quot;2h&quot; for
two hours, or &quot;4w&quot; for 4 weeks.
<P>
Defaults: bootlimit=1h, toolonglimit=-1 (infinite), color=yellow.
<P>
<P>
<B>CLOCK max.offset [color]</B>

<P>
The cpu status goes yellow/red if the system clock on the client
differs more than &quot;max.offset&quot; seconds from that of the Xymon
server. Note that this is not a particularly accurate test, since 
it is affected by network delays between the client and the server,
and the load on both systems. You should therefore not rely on this
being accurate to more than +/- 5 seconds, but it will let you
catch a client clock that goes completely wrong. The default is
NOT to check the system clock.
<BR>

<B>NOTE:</B> Correct operation of this test obviously requires that
the system clock of the Xymon server is correct. You should therefore
make sure that the Xymon server is synchronized to the real clock,
e.g. by using NTP.
<P>
<P>
Example: Go yellow if the load average exceeds 5, and red if it
exceeds 10. Also, go yellow for 10 minutes after a reboot, and after 
4 weeks uptime. Finally, check that the system clock is at most
15 seconds offset from the clock of the Xymon system and go red if 
that is exceeded.
<DL COMPACT>

<H2>DISK STATUS COLUMN SETTINGS</H2>

<P>
<B>DISK filesystem warnlevel paniclevel</B>

<BR>

<B>DISK filesystem IGNORE</B>

<BR>

<B>INODE filesystem warnlevel paniclevel</B>

<BR>

<B>INODE filesystem IGNORE</B>

<P>
If the utilization of &quot;filesystem&quot; is reported to exceed &quot;warnlevel&quot;
or &quot;paniclevel&quot;, the &quot;disk&quot; status will go yellow or red, respectively.
&quot;warnlevel&quot; and &quot;paniclevel&quot; are either the percentage used, or the 
space available as reported by the local &quot;df&quot; command on the host.
For the latter type of check, the &quot;warnlevel&quot; must be followed by the
letter &quot;U&quot;, e.g. &quot;1024U&quot;.
<P>
The special keyword &quot;IGNORE&quot; causes this filesystem to be ignored
completely, i.e. it will not appear in the &quot;disk&quot; status column and
it will not be tracked in a graph. This is useful for e.g. removable
devices, backup-disks and similar hardware.
<P>
&quot;filesystem&quot; is the mount-point where the filesystem is mounted, e.g.
&quot;/usr&quot; or &quot;/home&quot;. A filesystem-name that begins with &quot;%&quot; is interpreted
as a Perl-compatible regular expression; e.g. &quot;%^/oracle.*/&quot; will match
any filesystem whose mountpoint begins with &quot;/oracle&quot;.
<P>
&quot;INODE&quot; works identical to &quot;DISK&quot;, but uses the count of i-nodes in
the filesystem instead of the amount of disk space. This requires
a 4.3.x or later Xymon client.
<P>
Defaults DISK: warnlevel=90%, paniclevel=95%

Defaults INODE: warnlevel=70%, paniclevel=90%

<P>
<B>MEMPHYS warnlevel paniclevel</B>

<BR>

<B>MEMACT warnlevel paniclevel</B>

<BR>

<B>MEMSWAP warnlevel paniclevel</B>

<P>
If the memory utilization exceeds the &quot;warnlevel&quot; or &quot;paniclevel&quot;, the
&quot;memory&quot; status will change to yellow or red, respectively.
Note: The words &quot;PHYS&quot;, &quot;ACT&quot; and &quot;SWAP&quot; are also recognized.
<P>
Example: Go yellow if more than 20% swap is used, and red if
more than 40% swap is used or the actual memory utilisation exceeds
90%. Dont alert on physical memory usage.

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PROCS STATUS COLUMN SETTINGS</H2>

<P>
<B>PROC processname minimumcount maximumcount color [TRACK=id] [TEXT=text]</B>

<P>
The &quot;ps&quot; listing sent by the client will be scanned for how many
processes containing &quot;processname&quot; are running, and this is then
matched against the min/max settings defined here. If the running
count is outside the thresholds, the color of the &quot;procs&quot; status
changes to &quot;color&quot;.
<P>
To check for a process that must NOT be running: Set minimum and
maximum to 0.
<P>
&quot;processname&quot; can be a simple string, in which case this string must
show up in the &quot;ps&quot; listing as a command. The scanner will find
a ps-listing of e.g. &quot;/usr/sbin/cron&quot; if you only specify &quot;processname&quot;
as &quot;cron&quot;.
&quot;processname&quot; can also be a Perl-compatiable regular expression, e.g.
&quot;%java.*inst[0123]&quot; can be used to find entries in the ps-listing for
&quot;java -Xmx512m inst2&quot; and &quot;java -Xmx256 inst3&quot;. In that case,
&quot;processname&quot; must begin with &quot;%&quot; followed by the regular expression.
Note that Xymon defaults to case-insensitive pattern matching; if that
is not what you want, put &quot;(?-i)&quot; between the &quot;%&quot; and the regular
expression to turn this off. E.g. &quot;%(?-i)HTTPD&quot; will match the
word HTTPD only when it is upper-case.
<BR>

If &quot;processname&quot; contains whitespace (blanks or TAB), you must enclose
the full string in double quotes - including the &quot;%&quot; if you use regular
expression matching. E.g.
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROC&nbsp;&quot;%xymond_channel&nbsp;--channel=data.*xymond_rrd&quot;&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;yellow
<P>
or
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROC&nbsp;&quot;java&nbsp;-DCLASSPATH=/opt/java/lib&quot;&nbsp;2&nbsp;5
<P>
You can have multiple &quot;PROC&quot; entries for the same host, all of the
checks are merged into the &quot;procs&quot; status and the most severe
check defines the color of the status.
<P>
The optional <B>TRACK=id</B> setting causes Xymon to track the number of
processes found in an RRD file, and put this into a graph which is shown
on the &quot;procs&quot; status display. The <B>id</B> setting is a simple text string 
which will be used as the legend for the graph, and also as part of the
RRD filename. It is recommended that you use only letters and digits for
the ID.
<BR>

Note that the process counts which are tracked are only performed once 
when the client does a poll cycle - i.e. the counts represent snapshots
of the system state, not an average value over the client poll cycle.
Therefore there may be peaks or dips in the actual process counts which
will not show up in the graphs, because they happen while the Xymon client
is not doing any polling.
<P>
The optional <B>TEXT=text</B> setting is used in the summary of the &quot;procs&quot;
status. Normally, the summary will show the &quot;processname&quot; to identify the
process and the related count and limits. But this may be a regular
expression which is not easily recognizable, so if defined, the <B>text</B> 
setting string will be used instead. This only affects the &quot;procs&quot; status
display - it has no effect on how the rule counts or recognizes processes
in the &quot;ps&quot; output.
<P>
Example: Check that &quot;cron&quot; is running:
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>PROC cron<BR>
<P>
Example: Check that at least 5 &quot;httpd&quot; processes are running, but not more than 20:
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>PROC httpd 5 20<BR>
<P>
Defaults:
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mincount=1, maxcount=-1 (unlimited), color=&quot;red&quot;.<BR>
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>Note that no processes are checked by default.<BR>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MSGS STATUS COLUMN SETTINGS</H2>

<P>
<B>LOG logfilename pattern [COLOR=color] [IGNORE=excludepattern]</B>

<P>
The Xymon client extracts interesting lines from one or 
more logfiles - see the
<I><A HREF="../man5/client-local.cfg.5.html">client-local.cfg</A>(5)</I>

man-page for information about how to configure which
logs a client should look at.
<P>
The <B>LOG</B> setting determine how these extracts of log entries
are processed, and what warnings or alerts trigger as a result.
<P>
&quot;logfilename&quot; is the name of the logfile. Only logentries from this filename 
will be matched against this rule.  Note that &quot;logfilename&quot; can be a regular 
expression (if prefixed with a '%' character).
<P>
&quot;pattern&quot; is a string or regular expression. If the logfile data matches 
&quot;pattern&quot;, it will trigger the &quot;msgs&quot; column to change color. If
no &quot;color&quot; parameter is present, the default is to go &quot;red&quot; when
the pattern is matched. To match against a regular expression, &quot;pattern&quot;
must begin with a '%' sign - e.g &quot;%WARNING|NOTICE&quot; will match any lines
containing either of these two words.
Note that Xymon defaults to case-insensitive pattern matching; if that
is not what you want, put &quot;(?-i)&quot; between the &quot;%&quot; and the regular
expression to turn this off. E.g. &quot;%(?-i)WARNING&quot; will match the
word WARNING only when it is upper-case.
<P>
&quot;excludepattern&quot; is a string or regular expression that can be used to 
filter out any unwanted strings that happen to match &quot;pattern&quot;.
<P>
Example: Trigger a red alert when the string &quot;ERROR&quot; appears in the &quot;/var/adm/syslog&quot; file:
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>LOG /var/adm/syslog ERROR<BR>
<P>
Example: Trigger a yellow warning on all occurrences of the word &quot;WARNING&quot;
or &quot;NOTICE&quot; in the &quot;daemon.log&quot; file, except those from the &quot;lpr&quot; system:
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>LOG /var/log/daemon.log %WARNING|NOTICE COLOR=yellow IGNORE=lpr<BR>
<P>
Defaults:
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>color=&quot;red&quot;, no &quot;excludepattern&quot;.<BR>
<P>
Note that no logfiles are checked by default. Any log data reported by a client 
will just show up on the &quot;msgs&quot; column with status OK (green).
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES STATUS COLUMN SETTINGS</H2>

<P>
<B>FILE filename [color] [things to check] [TRACK]</B>

<P>
<B>DIR directoryname [color] [size&lt;MAXSIZE] [size&gt;MINSIZE] [TRACK]</B>

<P>
These entries control the status of the &quot;files&quot; column. They allow you to
check on various data for files and directories.
<P>
<B>filename</B> and <B>directoryname</B> are names of files or directories,
with a full path. You can use a regular expression to match the names of
files and directories reported by the client, if you prefix the expression
with a '%' character.
<P>
<B>color</B> is the color that triggers when one or more of the checks fail.
<P>
The <B>TRACK</B> keyword causes the size of the file or directory to be tracked
in an RRD file, and presented in a graph on the &quot;files&quot; status display.
<P>
For files, you can check one or more of the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>noexist<DD>
triggers a warning if the file exists. By default,
a warning is triggered for files that have a FILE entry, but
which do not exist.
<DT>type=TYPE<DD>
where TYPE is one of &quot;file&quot;, &quot;dir&quot;, &quot;char&quot;, &quot;block&quot;,
&quot;fifo&quot;, or &quot;socket&quot;. Triggers warning if the file is not of the
specified type.
<DT>ownerid=OWNER<DD>
triggers a warning if the owner does not match what is listed here.
OWNER is specified either with the numeric uid, or the user name.
<DT>groupid=GROUP<DD>
triggers a warning if the group does not match what is listed here.
GROUP is specified either with the numeric gid, or the group name.
<DT>mode=MODE<DD>
triggers a warning if the file permissions are not
as listed. MODE is written in the standard octal notation, e.g.
&quot;644&quot; for the rw-r--r-- permissions.
<DT>size&lt;MAX.SIZE and size&gt;MIN.SIZE<DD>
triggers a warning it the file size is greater than MAX.SIZE or 
less than MIN.SIZE, respectively. For filesizes, you can use the
letters &quot;K&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;G&quot; or &quot;T&quot; to indicate that the filesize is in
Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes or Terabytes, respectively. If there
is no such modifier, Kilobytes is assumed. E.g. to warn if a file 
grows larger than 1MB, use <B>size&lt;1024M</B>.
<DT>mtime&gt;MIN.MTIME mtime&lt;MAX.MTIME<DD>
checks how long ago the file was last modified (in seconds). E.g. 
to check if a file was updated within the past 10 minutes (600 
seconds): <B>mtime&lt;600</B>. Or to check that a file has NOT been updated 
in the past 24 hours: <B>mtime&gt;86400</B>.
<DT>mtime=TIMESTAMP<DD>
checks if a file was last modified at TIMESTAMP.  TIMESTAMP is a unix epoch 
time (seconds since midnight Jan 1 1970 UTC).
<DT>ctime&gt;MIN.CTIME, ctime&lt;MAX.CTIME, ctime=TIMESTAMP<DD>
acts as the mtime checks, but for the ctime timestamp (when the directory
entry of the file was last changed, eg. by chown, chgrp or chmod).
<DT>md5=MD5SUM, sha1=SHA1SUM, rmd160=RMD160SUM<DD>
trigger a warning if the file checksum using the MD5, SHA1 or RMD160 
message digest algorithms do not match the one configured here. Note: 
The &quot;file&quot; entry in the
<I><A HREF="../man5/client-local.cfg.5.html">client-local.cfg</A>(5)</I>

file must specify which algorithm to use.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

For directories, you can check one or more of the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>size&lt;MAX.SIZE and size&gt;MIN.SIZE<DD>
triggers a warning it the directory size is greater than MAX.SIZE or 
less than MIN.SIZE, respectively. Directory sizes are reported in 
whatever unit the <B>du</B> command on the client uses - often KB 
or diskblocks - so MAX.SIZE and MIN.SIZE must be given in the same
unit.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

Experience shows that it can be difficult to get these rules right.
Especially when defining minimum/maximum values for file sizes, when
they were last modified etc. The one thing you must remember when
setting up these checks is that the rules describe criteria that must 
be met - only when they are met will the status be green.
<P>
So &quot;mtime&lt;600&quot; means &quot;the difference between current time and the mtime
of the file must be less than 600 seconds - if not, the file status will
go red&quot;.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PORTS STATUS COLUMN SETTINGS</H2>

<P>
<B>PORT criteria [MIN=mincount] [MAX=maxcount] [COLOR=color] [TRACK=id] [TEXT=displaytext]</B>

<P>
The &quot;netstat&quot; listing sent by the client will be scanned for how many
sockets match the <B>criteria</B> listed.  The criteria you can use are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>LOCAL=addr<DD>
&quot;addr&quot; is a (partial) local address specification in the format used on
the output from netstat.
<DT>EXLOCAL=addr<DD>
Exclude certain local adresses from the rule.
<DT>REMOTE=addr<DD>
&quot;addr&quot; is a (partial) remote address specification in the format used on
the output from netstat.
<DT>EXREMOTE=addr<DD>
Exclude certain remote adresses from the rule.
<DT>STATE=state<DD>
Causes only the sockets in the specified state to be included, &quot;state&quot;
is usually LISTEN or ESTABLISHED but can be any socket state reported by
the clients &quot;netstat&quot; command.
<DT>EXSTATE=state<DD>
Exclude certain states from the rule.
</DL>
<P>

&quot;addr&quot; is typically &quot;10.0.0.1:80&quot; for the IP 10.0.0.1, port 80. 
Or &quot;*:80&quot; for any local address, port 80. Note that the Xymon clients 
normally report only the numeric data for IP-adresses and port-numbers, 
so you must specify the port number (e.g. &quot;80&quot;) instead of the service 
name (&quot;www&quot;).
<BR>

&quot;addr&quot; and &quot;state&quot; can also be a Perl-compatiable regular expression, e.g.
&quot;LOCAL=%[.:](80|443)&quot; can be used to find entries in the netstat local port for
both http (port 80) and https (port 443). In that case, portname or state must
begin with &quot;%&quot; followed by the reg.expression.
<P>
The socket count found is then matched against the min/max settings defined
here. If the count is outside the thresholds, the color of the &quot;ports&quot;
status changes to &quot;color&quot;.  To check for a socket that must NOT exist: Set 
minimum and maximum to 0.
<P>
The optional <B>TRACK=id</B> setting causes Xymon to track the number of
sockets found in an RRD file, and put this into a graph which is shown
on the &quot;ports&quot; status display. The <B>id</B> setting is a simple text string 
which will be used as the legend for the graph, and also as part of the
RRD filename. It is recommended that you use only letters and digits for
the ID.
<BR>

Note that the sockets counts which are tracked are only performed once 
when the client does a poll cycle - i.e. the counts represent snapshots
of the system state, not an average value over the client poll cycle.
Therefore there may be peaks or dips in the actual sockets counts which
will not show up in the graphs, because they happen while the Xymon client
is not doing any polling.
<P>
The <B>TEXT=displaytext</B> option affects how the port appears on the
&quot;ports&quot; status page. By default, the port is listed with the
local/remote/state rules as identification, but this may be somewhat
difficult to understand. You can then use e.g. &quot;TEXT=Secure Shell&quot; to make
these ports appear with the name &quot;Secure Shell&quot; instead.
<P>
Defaults: mincount=1, maxcount=-1 (unlimited), color=&quot;red&quot;.
Note: No ports are checked by default.
<P>
Example: Check that the SSH daemon is listening on port 22. Track the
number of active SSH connections, and warn if there are more than 5.
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PORT&nbsp;LOCAL=%[.:]22$&nbsp;STATE=LISTEN&nbsp;&quot;TEXT=SSH&nbsp;listener&quot;

<H2>DS - RRD based status override</H2>

<P>
<B>DS column filename:dataset rules COLOR=colorname TEXT=explanation</B>

<P>
&quot;column&quot; is the statuscolumn that will be modified. &quot;filename&quot; is
the name of the RRD file holding the data you use for comparison.
&quot;dataset&quot; is the name of the dataset in the RRD file - the &quot;rrdtool info&quot;
command is useful when determining these.
&quot;rules&quot; determine when to apply the override. You can use
&quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;=&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;=&quot; to compare the current measurement
value against one or more thresholds. &quot;explanation&quot; is a text
that will be shown to explain the override - you can use some
placeholders in the text: &quot;&amp;N&quot; is replaced with the name of the
dataset, &quot;&amp;V&quot; is replaced with the current value, &quot;&amp;L&quot; is replaced
by the low threshold, &quot;&amp;U&quot; is replaced with the upper threshold.
<P>
NOTE: This rule uses the raw data value from a client
to examine the rules. So this type of test is only really
suitable for datasets that are of the &quot;GAUGE&quot; type. It cannot
be used meaningfully for datasets that use &quot;COUNTER&quot; or
&quot;DERIVE&quot; - e.g. the datasets that are used to capture network
packet traffic - because the data stored in the RRD for
COUNTER-based datasets undergo a transformation (calculation)
when going into the RRD. Xymon does not have direct access to
the calculated data.
<P>
Example: Flag &quot;conn&quot; status a yellow if responsetime exceeds
100 msec.
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>DS conn tcp.conn.rrd:sec &gt;0.1 COLOR=yellow TEXT=&quot;Response time &amp;V exceeds &amp;U seconds&quot;<BR>

<BR>

<B>MQ_CHANNEL channelname [warning=PATTERN] [alert=PATTERN]</B>

<P>
This is a set of checks for checking the health of IBM MQ message-queues.
It requires the &quot;mq.sh&quot; or similar collector module to run on a node with
access to the MQ &quot;Queue Manager&quot; so it can report the status of queues
and channels.
<P>
The MQ_QUEUE setting checks the health of a single queue: You can warn 
(yellow) or alert (red) based on the depth of the queue, and/or the
age of the oldest entry in the queue. These values are taken directly
from the output generated by the &quot;runmqsc&quot; utility.
<P>
The MQ_CHANNEL setting checks the health of a single MQ channel: You
can warn or alert based on the reported status of the channel. The
PATTERN is a normal pattern, i.e. either a list of status keywords,
or a regular expression pattern.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CHANGING THE DEFAULT SETTINGS</H2>

If you would like to use different defaults for the settings described above, 
then you can define the new defaults after a DEFAULT line. E.g. this would
explicitly define all of the default settings:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<PRE>
DEFAULT
        UP      1h
        LOAD    5.0 10.0
        DISK    * 90 95
        MEMPHYS 100 101
        MEMSWAP 50 80
        MEMACT  90 97
</PRE>

</DL>
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RULES TO SELECT HOSTS</H2>

All of the settings can be applied to a group of hosts, by preceding them with
rules. A rule defines of one of more filters using these keywords (note that
this is identical to the rule definitions used in the
<I><A HREF="../man5/alerts.cfg.5.html">alerts.cfg</A>(5)</I>

file).
<P>
<B>PAGE=targetstring</B>

Rule matching an alert by the name of the page in Xymon. &quot;targetstring&quot; is the path of
the page as defined in the hosts.cfg file. E.g. if you have this setup:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<PRE>
page servers All Servers
subpage web Webservers
10.0.0.1 www1.foo.com
subpage db Database servers
10.0.0.2 db1.foo.com
</PRE>

</DL>
<P>

Then the &quot;All servers&quot; page is found with <B>PAGE=servers</B>, the 
&quot;Webservers&quot; page is <B>PAGE=servers/web</B> and the &quot;Database servers&quot;
page is <B>PAGE=servers/db</B>. Note that you can also use regular expressions 
to specify the page name, e.g. <B>PAGE=%.*/db</B> would find the &quot;Database
servers&quot; page regardless of where this page was placed in the hierarchy.
<P>
The top-level page has a the fixed name <B>/</B>, e.g. <B>PAGE=/</B> would 
match all hosts on the Xymon frontpage. If you need it in a regular
expression, use <B>PAGE=%^/</B> to avoid matching the forward-slash
present in subpage-names.
<P>
<B>EXPAGE=targetstring</B>

Rule excluding a host if the pagename matches.
<P>
<B>HOST=targetstring</B>

Rule matching a host by the hostname.
&quot;targetstring&quot; is either a comma-separated list of hostnames (from the hosts.cfg file),
&quot;*&quot; to indicate &quot;all hosts&quot;, or a Perl-compatible regular expression.
E.g. &quot;HOST=dns.foo.com,<A HREF="http://www.foo.com">www.foo.com</A>&quot; identifies two specific hosts;
&quot;HOST=%www.*.foo.com EXHOST=www-test.foo.com&quot; matches all hosts with a name
beginning with &quot;www&quot;, except the &quot;www-test&quot; host.
<P>
<B>EXHOST=targetstring</B>

Rule excluding a host by matching the hostname.
<P>
<B>CLASS=classname</B>

Rule match by the client class-name. You specify the class-name 
for a host when starting the client through the &quot;--class=NAME&quot;
option to the runclient.sh script. If no class is specified, the
host by default goes into a class named by the operating system.
<P>
<B>EXCLASS=classname</B>

Exclude all hosts belonging to &quot;classname&quot; from this rule.
<P>
<B>DISPLAYGROUP=groupstring</B>

Rule matching an alert by the text of the display-group (text following the group, 
group-only, group-except heading) in the hosts.cfg file. &quot;groupstring&quot; is the text
for the group, stripped of any HTML tags. E.g. if you have this setup:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<PRE>
group Web
10.0.0.1 www1.foo.com
10.0.0.2 www2.foo.com
group Production databases
10.0.1.1 db1.foo.com
</PRE>

</DL>
<P>

Then the hosts in the Web-group can be matched with <B>DISPLAYGROUP=Web</B>,
and the database servers can be matched with <B>DISPLAYGROUP=&quot;Production databases&quot;</B>.
Note that you can also use regular expressions, e.g. <B>DISPLAYGROUP=%database</B>.
If there is no group-setting for the host, use &quot;DISPLAYGROUP=NONE&quot;.
<P>
<B>EXDISPLAYGROUP=groupstring</B>

Rule excluding a group by matching the display-group string.
<P>
<B>TIME=timespecification</B>

Rule matching by the time-of-day. This is specified as the DOWNTIME 
time specification in the hosts.cfg file.  E.g. &quot;TIME=W:0800:2200&quot;
applied to a rule will make this rule active only on week-days between
8AM and 10PM.
<P>

<H2>DIRECTING ALERTS TO GROUPS</H2>

For some tests - e.g. &quot;procs&quot; or &quot;msgs&quot; - the right group of people
to alert in case of a failure may be different, depending on which 
of the client rules actually detected a problem. E.g. if you have
PROCS rules for a host checking both &quot;httpd&quot; and &quot;sshd&quot; processes,
then the Web admins should handle httpd-failures, whereas &quot;sshd&quot;
failures are handled by the Unix admins.
<P>
To handle this, all rules can have a &quot;GROUP=groupname&quot; setting.
When a rule with this setting triggers a yellow or red status,
the groupname is passed on to the Xymon alerts module, so you
can use it in the alert rule definitions in 
<I><A HREF="../man5/alerts.cfg.5.html">alerts.cfg</A>(5)</I>

to direct alerts to the correct group of people.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RULES: APPLYING SETTINGS TO SELECTED HOSTS</H2>

Rules must be placed after the settings, e.g.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<PRE>
LOAD 8.0 12.0  HOST=db.foo.com TIME=*:0800:1600
</PRE>

</DL>
<P>

<P>
If you have multiple settings that you want to apply the same rules to,
you can write the rules *only* on one line, followed by the settings. E.g.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<PRE>
HOST=%db.*.foo.com TIME=W:0800:1600
        LOAD 8.0 12.0
        DISK /db  98 100
        PROC mysqld 1
</PRE>

</DL>
<P>

will apply the three settings to all of the &quot;db&quot; hosts on week-days between 8AM
and 4PM. This can be combined with per-settings rule, in which case the
per-settings rule overrides the general rule; e.g.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<PRE>
HOST=%.*.foo.com
        LOAD 7.0 12.0 HOST=bax.foo.com
        LOAD 3.0 8.0
</PRE>

</DL>
<P>

will result in the load-limits being 7.0/12.0 for the &quot;bax.foo.com&quot; host,
and 3.0/8.0 for all other foo.com hosts.
<P>
The entire file is evaluated from the top to bottom, and the first
match found is used. So you should put the specific settings first, and
the generic ones last.
<P>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

For the LOG, FILE and DIR checks, it is necessary also to configure the actual 
file- and directory-names in the
<I><A HREF="../man5/client-local.cfg.5.html">client-local.cfg</A>(5)</I>

file. If the filenames are not listed there, the clients will not collect
any data about these files/directories, and the settings in the 
analysis.cfg file will be silently ignored.
<P>
The ability to compute file checksums with MD5, SHA1 or RMD160 should not be
used for general-purpose file integrity checking, since the overhead of calculating
these on a large number of files can be significant. If you need this, look at
tools designed for this purpose - e.g. Tripwire or AIDE.
<P>
At the time of writing (april 2006), the SHA-1 and RMD160 algorithms are considered
cryptographically safe. The MD5 algorithm has been shown to have some weaknesses, and
is not considered strong enough when a high level of security is required.
