xymon-webaccess - Web-based access controls in Xymon
<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Xymon does not provide any built-in authentication (login) mechanism.
Instead, it relies on the access controls available in your web server,
e.g. the Apache <B>mod_auth</B> modules.
<P>
This provides a simple way of controlling access to the physical
directories that make up the pages and subpages with the hosts
defined in your Xymon
<I><A HREF="../man5/hosts.cfg.5.html">hosts.cfg</A>(5)</I>

setup - you can use the Apache &quot;require&quot; setting to allow or deny
access to information on any page, usually through the use of a
&quot;Require group ...&quot; setting. The group name then refers to one
or more groups in an Apache <B>AuthGroupFile</B> file.
<P>
However, this does not work for the Xymon CGI programs since they 
are used to fetch information about all hosts in Xymon, but there
is only a single directory holding all of the CGI's. So here you
can only require that the user is logged-in (the Apache &quot;Require valid-user&quot;
directive). A user with a login can - if he knows the hostname - 
manipulate the request sent to the webserver and fetch information
about any status by use of the Xymon CGI programs, even though he
cannot see the overview webpages.
<P>
To alleviate this situation, the following Xymon CGI's support a
&quot;--access=FILENAME&quot; option, where FILENAME is an Apache compatible
group-definitions file:
<BR>

<I><A HREF="../man1/svcstatus.cgi.1.html">svcstatus.cgi</A>(1)</I>

<BR>

<I><A HREF="../man1/acknowledge.cgi.1.html">acknowledge.cgi</A>(1)</I>

<BR>

<I><A HREF="../man1/enadis.cgi.1.html">enadis.cgi</A>(1)</I>

<BR>

<I><A HREF="../man1/appfeed.cgi.1.html">appfeed.cgi</A>(1)</I>

<P>
When invoked with this option the CGI will read the Apache
group-definitions file, and assume that an Apache <B>group</B>
maps to a Xymon <B>page</B>, and then - based on the logged-in userid - 
determine which pages and hosts the user is allowed access to.
Only information about those hosts will be made available by the CGI
tool.
<P>
Members of the group <B>root</B> has access to all hosts.
<P>
Access will also be granted, if the user is a member of a group
with the same name as the <B>host</B> being requested, or as the
<B>statuscolumn</B> being requested.
