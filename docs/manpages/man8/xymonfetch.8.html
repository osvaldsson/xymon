xymonfetch - fetch client data from passive clients

<B>xymonfetch [--server=XYMON.SERVER.IP] [options]</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This utility is used to collect data from Xymon clients.
<P>
Normally, Xymon clients will themselves take care of sending
all of their data directly to the Xymon server. In that case,
you do not need this utility at all. However, in some network 
setups clients may be prohibited from establishing a connection
to an external server such as the Xymon server, due to firewall 
policies. In such a setup you can configure the client to store
all of the client data locally by enabling the
<I><A HREF="../man8/msgcache.8.html">msgcache</A>(8)</I>

utility on the client, and using <B>xymonfetch</B> on the Xymon
server to collect data from the clients.
<P>
xymonfetch will only collect data from clients that have the
<B>pulldata</B> tag listed in the
<I><A HREF="../man5/hosts.cfg.5.html">hosts.cfg</A>(5)</I>

file. The IP-address listed in the hosts.cfg file must be correct,
since this is the IP-address where xymonfetch will attempt to contact
the client.  If the msgcache daemon is running on a non-standard 
IP-address or portnumber, you can specify the portnumber as in
<B>pulldata=192.168.1.2:8084</B> for contacting the msgcache daemon 
using IP 192.168.1.2 port 8084. If the IP-address is omitted, the
default IP in the hosts.cfg file is used. If the port number is
omitted, the portnumber from the XYMONDPORT setting in
<I><A HREF="../man5/xymonserver.cfg.5.html">xymonserver.cfg</A>(5)</I>

is used (normally, this is port 1984).
<P>

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--server=XYMON.SERVER.IP<DD>
Defines the IP address of the Xymon server where the collected client
messages are forwarded to. By default, messages are sent to the
loopback address 127.0.0.1, i.e. to a Xymon server running on the same 
host as xymonfetch.
<P>
<DT>--interval=N<DD>
Sets the interval (in seconds) between polls of a client. Default: 60 seconds.
<P>
<DT>--id=N<DD>
Used when you have a setup with multiple Xymon servers. In that case, you
must run xymonfetch on each of the Xymon servers, with xymonfetch instance
using a different value of N. This allows several Xymon servers to pick up
data from the clients running msgcache, and msgcache can distinguish between
which messages have already been forwarded to which server.
<BR>

N is a number in the range 1-31.
<P>
<DT>--log-interval=N<DD>
Limit how often xymonfetch will log problems with fetching data from a
host, in seconds. Default: 900 seconds (15 minutes). This is to prevent
a host that is down or where msgcache has not been started from flooding
the xymonfetch logs. Note that this is ignored when debugging is enabled.
<P>
<DT>--debug<DD>
Enable debugging output.
