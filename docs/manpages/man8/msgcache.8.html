<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>msgcache</B> implements a Xymon message cache. It is intended for use
with clients which cannot deliver their data to the Xymon server in
the normal way. Instead of having the client tools connect to the 
Xymon server, msgcache runs locally and the client tools then
deliver their data to the msgcache daemon. The msgcache daemon is
then polled regularly by the
<I><A HREF="../man8/xymonfetch.8.html">xymonfetch</A>(8)</I>

utility, which collects the client messages stored by msgcache
and forwards them to the Xymon server.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> When using msgcache, the <B>XYMSRV</B> setting for
the clients should be <B>XYMSRV=127.0.0.1</B> instead of pointing
at the real Xymon server.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RESTRICTIONS</H2>

Clients delivering their data to msgcache instead of the real
Xymon server will in general not notice this. Specifically,
the client configuration data provided by the Xymon server when
a client delivers its data is forwarded through the xymonfetch / 
msgcache chain, so the normal centralized client configuration
works.
<P>
However, other commands which rely on clients communicating
directly with the Xymon server will not work. This includes
the <B>config</B> and <B>query</B> commands which clients may
use to fetch configuration files and query the Xymon server
for a current status.
<P>
The <B>download</B> command also does not work with msgcache.
This means that the automatic client update facility will
not work for clients communicating via msgcache.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--listen=IPADDRESS[:PORT]<DD>
Defines the IP-address and portnumber where msgcache listens for 
incoming connections. By default, msgcache listens for connections
on all network interfaces, port 1984.
<P>
<DT>--server=IPADDRESS[,IPADDRESS]<DD>
Restricts which servers are allowed to pick up the cached messages.
By default anyone can contact the msgcache utility and request all
of the cached messages. This option allows only the listed servers
to request the cached messages.
<P>
<DT>--max-age=N<DD>
Defines how long cached messages are kept. If the message has not 
been picked up with N seconds after being delivered to msgcache,
it is silently discarded. Default: N=600 seconds (10 minutes).
<P>
<DT>--daemon<DD>
Run as a daemon, i.e. msgcache will detach from the terminal and
run as a background task
<P>
<DT>--no-daemon<DD>
Run as a foreground task. This option must be used when msgcache
is started by
<I><A HREF="../man8/xymonlaunch.8.html">xymonlaunch</A>(8)</I>

which is the normal way of running msgcache.
<P>
<DT>--pidfile=FILENAME<DD>
Store the process ID of the msgcache task in FILENAME.
<P>
<DT>--logfile=FILENAME<DD>
Log msgcache output to FILENAME.
<P>
<DT>--debug<DD>
Enable debugging output.
