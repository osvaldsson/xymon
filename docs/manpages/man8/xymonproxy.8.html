xymonproxy - Xymon message proxy

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I><A HREF="../man8/xymonproxy.8.html">xymonproxy</A>(8)</I>

is a proxy for forwarding Xymon messages from one
server to another. It will typically be needed if you have
clients behind a firewall, so they cannot send status
messages to the Xymon server directly.
<P>
xymonproxy serves three purposes. First, it acts as a regular
proxy server, allowing clients that cannot connect directly to 
the Xymon servers to send data. Although xymonproxy is optimized for handling
status messages, it will forward all types of messages, including
notes- and data-messages.
<BR>

<P>
Second, it acts as a buffer, smoothing out peak loads if
many clients try to send status messages simultaneously.
xymonproxy can absorb messages very quickly, but will queue
them up internally and forward them to the Xymon server
at a reasonable pace.
<BR>

<P>
Third, xymonproxy merges small &quot;status&quot; messages into larger
&quot;combo&quot; messages. This can dramatically decrease the number
of connections that need to go from xymonproxy to the Xymon
server.  The merging of messages causes &quot;status&quot; messages 
to be delayed for up to 0.25 seconds before being sent off 
to the Xymon server.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--server=SERVERIP[:PORT][,SERVER2IP[:PORT]]<DD>
Specifies the IP-address and optional portnumber where incoming
messages are forwarded to. The default portnumber is 1984, the
standard Xymon port number. If you have setup the normal
Xymon environment, you can use &quot;--server=$XYMSRV&quot;. Up
to 3 servers can be specified; incoming messages are sent to
all of them (except &quot;config&quot;, &quot;query&quot; and &quot;download&quot; messages, 
which go to the LAST server only). If you have Xymon clients
sending their data via this proxy, note that the clients will
receive their configuration data from the LAST of the servers
listed here.  This option is required.
<P>
<DT>--listen=LOCALIP[:PORT]<DD>
Specifies the IP-adress where xymonproxy listens for incoming 
connections. By default, xymonproxy listens on all IP-adresses
assigned to the host. If no portnumber is given, port 1984
will be used.
<P>
<DT>--timeout=N<DD>
Specifies the number of seconds after which a connection is
aborted due to a timeout. Default: 10 seconds.
<P>
<DT>--report=[PROXYHOSTNAME.]SERVICE<DD>
If given, this option causes xymonproxy to send a status report
every 5 minutes to the Xymon server about itself. If you
have set the standard Xymon environment, you can use
&quot;--report=xymonproxy&quot; to have xymonproxy report its status to a
&quot;xymonproxy&quot; column in Xymon. The default for PROXYHOSTNAME
is the $MACHINE environment variable, i.e. the hostname of the
server running xymonproxy. See REPORT OUTPUT below for an 
explanation of the report contents.
<P>
<DT>--lqueue=N<DD>
Size of the listen-queue where incoming connections can
queue up before being processed. This should be large to
accomodate bursts of activity from clients. Default: 512.
<P>
<DT>--daemon<DD>
Run in daemon mode, i.e. detach and run as a background proces.
This is the default.
<P>
<DT>--no-daemon<DD>
Runs xymonproxy as a foreground proces.
<P>
<DT>--pidfile=FILENAME<DD>
Specifies the location of a file containing the proces-ID 
of the xymonproxy daemon proces. Default: /var/run/xymonproxy.pid.
<P>
<DT>--logfile=FILENAME<DD>
Sends all logging output to the specified file instead of stderr.
<P>
<DT>--log-details<DD>
Log details (IP-address, message type and hostname) to the logfile.
This can also be enabled and disabled at run-time by sending the
xymonproxy proces a SIGUSR1 signal.
<P>
<DT>--debug<DD>
Enable debugging output.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>REPORT OUTPUT</H2>

If enabled via the &quot;--report&quot; option, xymonproxy will send a 
status message about itself to the Xymon server once
every 5 minutes.
<P>
The status message includes the following information:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Incoming messages<DD>
The total number of connections accepted from clients
since the proxy started. The &quot;(N msgs/second)&quot; is the 
average number of messages per second over the past 5 minutes.
<P>
<DT>Outbound messages<DD>
The total number of messages sent to the Xymon server. 
Note that this is probably smaller than
the number of incoming messages, since xymonproxy merges
messages before sending them.
<P>
<DT>Incoming - Combo messages<DD>
The number of &quot;combo&quot; messages received from a client.
<P>
<DT>Incoming - Status messages<DD>
The number of &quot;status&quot; messages received from a client.
xymonproxy attempts to merge these into &quot;combo&quot; messages. 
The &quot;Messages merged&quot; is the number of &quot;status&quot; messages
that were merged into a combo message, the &quot;Resulting combos&quot;
is the number of &quot;combo&quot; messages that resulted from the
merging.
<P>
<DT>Incoming - Other messages<DD>
The number of other messages (data, notes, ack, query, ...)
messages received from a client.
<P>
<DT>Proxy ressources - Connection table size<DD>
This is the number of connection table slots in the proxy.
This measures the number of simultaneously active requests
that the proxy has handled, and so gives an idea about the
peak number of clients that the proxy has handled simultaneously.
<P>
<DT>Proxy ressources - Buffer space<DD>
This is the number of KB memory allocated for network buffers.
<P>
<DT>Timeout details - reading from client<DD>
The number of messages dropped because reading the message
from the client timed out.
<P>
<DT>Timeout details - connecting to server<DD>
The number of messages dropped, because a connection to the
Xymon server could not be established.
<P>
<DT>Timeout details - sending to server<DD>
The number of messages dropped because the communication
to the Xymon server timed out after a connection
was established.
<P>
<DT>Timeout details - recovered<DD>
When a timeout happens while sending the status message to 
the server, xymonproxy will attempt to recover the message and
retry sending it to the server after waiting a few seconds.
This number is the number of messages that were recovered,
and so were not lost.
<P>
<DT>Timeout details - reading from server<DD>
The number of response messages that timed out while attempting
to read them from the server. Note that this applies to the
&quot;config&quot; and &quot;query&quot; messages only, since all other message
types do not get any response from the servers.
<P>
<DT>Timeout details - sending to client<DD>
The number of response messages that timed out while attempting
to send them to the client. Note that this applies to the
&quot;config&quot; and &quot;query&quot; messages only, since all other message
types do not get any response from the servers.
<P>
<DT>Average queue time<DD>
The average time it took the proxy to process a message,
calculated from the messages that have passed through the
proxy during the past 5 minutes. This number is computed
from the messages that actually end up establishing a
connection to the Xymon server, i.e. status 
messages that were combined into combo-messages do not
go into the calculation - if they did, it would reduce the
average time, since it is faster to merge messages than
send them out over the network.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2></H2>

If you think the numbers do not add up, here is how they relate.
<P>
The &quot;Incoming messages&quot; should be equal to the sum of the 
&quot;Incoming Combo/Status/Page/Other messages&quot;, or slightly
more because messages in transit are not included
in the per-type message counts.
<P>
The &quot;Outbound messages&quot; should be equal to sum of the
&quot;Incoming Combo/Page/Other messages&quot;, plus the &quot;Resulting
combos&quot; count, plus &quot;Incoming Status messages&quot; minus 
&quot;Messages merged&quot; (this latter number is the number of status
messages that were NOT merged into combos, but sent directly).
The &quot;Outbound messages&quot; may be slightly lower than that,
because messages in transit are not included in the
&quot;Outbound messages&quot; count until they have been fully sent.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SIGNALS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>SIGHUP<DD>
Re-opens the logfile, e.g. after it has been rotated.
<P>
<DT>SIGTERM<DD>
Shut down the proxy.
<P>
<DT>SIGUSR1<DD>
Toggles logging of individual messages.
