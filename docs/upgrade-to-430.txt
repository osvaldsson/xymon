Upgrading from Hobbit 4.0 / 4.2 / 4.3.0 beta 1 / 4.3.0 beta 2
=============================================================

Xymon was renamed from "Hobbit" to "Xymon" during the 4.3.0
development cycle. That meant there were quite a few names
being used for Xymon for historical reasons:
- "Big Brother" or "BB" (really the original software from Quest)
- "bbgen" (the precursor to Xymon, which used the Big Brother server)
- "Hobbit"
and finally "Xymon". This was evident in the names of configuration
files, programs, tools, commands, webpages, status columns etc. etc. 

The forced change of name from Hobbit to Xymon was seen as a good
time to clean up this spaghetti of various names. So with the
4.3.0-beta3 release, all references to the old names have been
eliminated from Xymon. However, that means upgrading involves a
bit of renaming stuff.

A script has been provided to help with this task. For it to
work, it is essential that you perform the upgrade like this:

1) Make sure you have a backup. It is not necessary to backup
   the data in the hist/, histlogs/, hostdata/ and rrd/ 
   directories (if you use the default directory layout, then
   that means the entire data/ directory need not be backed up).
2) Configure Xymon 4.3.0 using a directory layout that is
   identical to your previous version. Make sure you keep the
   directory names exactly as they were in the version you are
   currently running, even though that may include "hobbit" in
   the directory name.
3) Build Xymon 4.3.0 (run "make")
4) Stop Hobbit (the current version).
5) Using the "bbcmd" utility from your current version, run
   then "./build/upgrade430.sh" script. I.e. run a command
   like
       ~hobbit/server/bin/bbcmd ./build/upgrade430.sh
   This will perform almost all of the file renaming and 
   configuration file updates that are needed when going
   to version 4.3. A few updates cannot be done automatically,
   you will be notified what else is needed after the script
   completes.
6) Install Xymon 4.3.0 (run "make install").

Your installation should now be upgraded to version 4.3.0.
Run your normal startup-script to launch Xymon, or the
	~hobbit/server/xymon.sh start
command.


If you don't feel comfortable doing the upgrade using the script,
the rest of this document describes what must be done. It assumes
that you perform a clean installation of Xymon 4.3.0, and then
move your old configuration and data over manually.


The ~xymon/server/etc/ directory
================================
Copy over the existing configuration files, then rename them 
as follows:

   Old name                     New name
   --------                     --------
mv bb-hosts                     hosts.cfg
mv bbcombotest.cfg              combo.cfg
mv hobbit-alerts.cfg            alerts.cfg
mv hobbit-nkview.cfg            critical.cfg
mv hobbit-rrddefinitions.cfg    rrddefinitions.cfg
mv hobbitgraph.cfg              graphs.cfg
mv hobbit-holidays.cfg          holidays.cfg
mv hobbit-clients.cfg           analysis.cfg
mv hobbit-snmpmibs.cfg          snmpmibs.cfg
mv bb-services                  protocols.cfg

Four files will require special attention:

"hobbitcgi.cfg" is renamed to "cgioptions.cfg". Three settings
in that file have been changed also: CGI_HOBBITCOLUMN_OPTS is
now CGI_COLUMNDOC_OPTS, CGI_HOBBITGRAPH_OPTS is now 
CGI_SHOWGRAPH_OPTS, and CGI_HOBBITCONFREPORT_OPTS is now 
CGI_CONFREPORT_OPTS.

"hobbitlaunch.cfg" is renamed to "tasks.cfg". However, most
of the programs have also been renamed, so it is probably easiest
if you use the standard tasks.cfg file as the starting point,
and the merge your local modifications into that file. If 
you have too many local modifications, see the "docs/Renaming-430.txt"
file for a list of all the new program names.

"hobbitserver.cfg" is renamed to "xymonserver.cfg". However
most of the settings inside that file have also been renamed.
As with hobbitlaunch.cfg, I would recommend that you start with
the default xymonserver.cfg file and use that as the basis for
merging in your local modifications. If that is not possible, then
you can use the xymond/etcfiles/xymonserver-migration.cfg file
together with your current hobbitserver.cfg file.

"hobbitclient.cfg" is renamed to "xymonclient.cfg". As with 
xymonserver.cfg, a lot of settings have been renamed, but since
this file has very few it is probably easiest to setup this file
from the standard file.

Finally, if you use the "nobb2" tag in your hosts.cfg, then this
has been deprecated. Please change it to "nonongreen".


The ~xymon/server/bin/ directory
================================
Most of the programs have changed names, so if you have custom 
scripts that use some of the programs then these will probably
break. I recommend that you setup symlinks for the following
programs in ~xymon/server/bin :

   ln -s xymon bb
   ln -s xymoncmd bbcmd
   ln -s xymongrep bbhostgrep
   ln -s xymoncfg bbhostshow
   ln -s xymondigest bbdigest


The ~xymon/server/web/ directory
================================
Some of the web template files have been renamed, and since the
menu system has also been completely changed it is not possible
to automatically migrate your local changes to the templates over.
In the docs/Renaming-430.txt file you can see what the new templates
are called.


The ~xymon/data/rrd/ directory
==============================
Some of the Xymon-servers' own status-messages have changed names,
and therefore the RRD graphs have also been renamed. So if you 
would like to keep the history of your Xymon server before the
upgrade, you must renamed some of the RRD files. In your
~xymon/data/rrd/XYMONSERVERNAME/ directory:

   mv bbgen.rrd     xymongen.rrd
   mv bbtest.rrd    xymonnet.rrd
   mv hobbit.rrd    xymon.rrd
   mv hobbit2.rrd   xymon2.rrd
   mv hobbitd.rrd   xymond.rrd
   mv bbproxy.rrd   xymonproxy.rrd

If you have multiple servers running Xymon tasks, do this in 
each of these servers' RRD-directory.


The Xymon internal statuses
===========================
If you have alerts defined for the internal Xymon statuses,
then you will have to change them since the names of the
internal statuses have changed. So in alerts.cfg, check
if you have any alerts for the "bbgen", "bbtest", "hobbitd"
or "bbproxy" statuses. If you do, then change them:

	bbgen		is now		xymongen
	bbtest		is now		xymonnet
	bbproxy		is now		xymonproxy
	hobbitd		is now		xymond


The Xymon webpages
==================
The three top-level Xymon webpages have also been renamed, so if
you use links directly to the "bb.html", "bb2.html" or "bbnk.html"
webpage, then these will have to be changed:

   bb.html		is now		xymon.html
   bb2.html		is now		nongreen.html
   bbnk.html		is now		critical.html
