.TH XYMONCGIMSG.CGI 8 "Version 4.3.7: 13 Dec 2011" "Xymon"

.SH NAME
xymoncgimsg.cgi \- CGI utility used for proxying Xymon data over HTTP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "xymoncgimsg.cgi"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I xymoncgimsg.cgi(8)
is the server-side utility receiving Xymon messages sent by the
.I xymon(1)
utility over an HTTP transport. The \fBxymon\fR utility normally sends
data over a dedicated TCP protocol, but it may use HTTP to go through
proxies or through restrictive firewalls. In that case, the webserver
must have this CGI utility installed, which takes care of receiving the
message via HTTP, and forwards it to a local Xymon server through the
normal Xymon transport.

The CGI expects to be invoked from an HTTP "POST" request,
with the POST-data being the status-message.
\fBxymoncgimsg.cgi\fR
simply collects all of the POST data, and send it off as
a message to the Xymon daemon running on IP 127.0.0.1. This
destination IP currently cannot be changed.

The CGI will return any output provided by the Xymon daemon
back to the requestor as the response to the HTTP POST,
so this allows for all normal Xymon commands to work.

.SH SECURITY
\fBxymoncgimsg.cgi\fR will only send data to a Xymon server through the
loopback interface, i.e. IP-address 127.0.0.1.

Access to the CGI should be restricted through webserver access controls,
since the CGI provides no authentication at all to validate incoming
messages.

If possible, consider using the
.I xymonproxy(8)
utility instead for native proxying of Xymon data between networks.
